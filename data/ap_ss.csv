Question: is it better to ship airpods to apple or take them to the apple store? I bought some airpods pro about a year  bought the full cover for it including accidents however it‚Äôs been a hassle for the last weeks trying to get them fixed‚Ä¶ the closest place i have is a best buy and they pretty much said they couldn‚Äôt do anything because all of their diagnostics came out okay. I go 30 miles north to an apple store and they tell me i need to check for an appointment with the apple store and they have like 4 day wait time plus it‚Äôs 30 miles away. 30 miles that i drove already.   At this point I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs even worth the hassle if I‚Äôll get new ones or fixed the same day ? ( the issue being the mic being muffled and little to no sound from the right airpod ). Or if I should just call and have them shipped? I never gotten insurance with any item before dint know it was gonna be such a pain to get the coverage.,apple

For 99.99999999999% of people, its use exclusively involves taking social/family pictures. The quality for these pictures is already great.

To me, it's always been a little anxiety-inducing knowing that I have years worth of notes stored in Apple Notes without any locally accessible backups. It's quite a relief to be able to just grab a quick snapshot of my entire notes library.  Anyway, this little utility works a treat! So, I just thought I'd pass it along. I'm not planning on moving to Bear (*yet... although it does look like a great app!*), but I'll definitely be running this utility every month or so as a back up.",apple

"Feature Suggestion: Disable Tap to Click While Typing Since the track pad size has increased on new MBPs I have found my cursor jumping around all too often. I can stop this by disabling tap to click, but I actually like that feature as it puts less strain on my hand to click on things when I use the trackpad.  I think it would be pretty easy to implement in the OS some kind of process that detects whether or not you're typing with &lt;500ms latency/error and disable tap to click while you're typing. Nobody uses the keyboard and the trackpad at the same time.  This would make typing so much more pleasurable.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk",apple

"iMac as external display Hello community,  I‚Äôm finding myself on a dilemma and perhaps I can clear all doubts here. I want to use an iMac as an external display to a MacBook Pro from 2019. Using the iMac as external monitor seems to be possible and described in the Apple support page.  The iMac in question has a Thunderbolt 2 and my MacBook 4 USB-C ports (Thunderbolt 3?) so in order to connect them I need a thunderbolt 2 to thunderbolt 3 adaptor, plus a usb-c cable.   While I was struggling to find this equipment in my area, guy from a of repair shop told me that such connection isn‚Äôt possible, that iMacs can export the desktop to an external monitor but never receive from another source. That sounded to me bullshit mainly because it seems to contradict Apple official support pages, and the support of target display mode on older iMacs.

My phone battery percentage dropped from 100% to 90% in just 10 Months. Her phone battery percentage is still 100% after 10 Months.   I used my phone for Internet on my PC sometimes, I used it not so much when charging. I didn‚Äôt played any games.  Is this something that Apple need to fix in the future or this is just how it‚Äôs works?",apple

"Complex Question on iPad Pro, MSFT Surface, Adobe PP, and FCP I have a travel documentary YouTube channel and do extensive video editing. I edit my work on Adobe Premiere Pro in my Gaming PC. I use a MBP as my laptop but its mostly used for notes and researching. I have been going back and forth to simplify my workflow and was thinking of the following, this might get messy:  * is an iPad Pro better than Surface? When I travel I carry my MBP and my wife's HP so I can transfer to her laptop and work some there. Will the iPad just be a glorified Notebook? * Should I just eliminate the Adobe PP and go with FCP (I've used both) and will the iPad Pro add any value to this mix? or am I just better off swapping for a Mac mini and carrying my MBP?  Reminder: All for work, I have a gaming PC but don't game, and I don't consume content.  &amp;#x200B;  thanks for your time.",apple

"Will Apple ever have a web app for Apple Books? I love Apple Books. The integrated store on the iOS app makes it so easy to buy and read books. And it's also very easy to see which books you are yet to buy in a collection you've started as they are listed in your collection with their respective price. These give an advantage over Amazon Kindle. However Kindle has it beat in one very important way - at least for me. While I'm at work, on quieter moments I can read Amazon Kindle books on my work PC via Kindle Cloud Reader. And of course that syncs with the iOS app. I just hate that the store isn't as user friendly as Apple Books, and that you have to manually add books to collections, and it's less user-friendly to see which books you haven't bought in a collection.  Regardless, my question is do we think Apple will make an Apple Books Cloud Reader too? They have already made a web app version of Apple Music. I just think it's crazy that anyone who is on PC has no access to their books.",apple

"Why do you use Apple? I‚Äôve used Apple products for years, and at this point I‚Äôm deep into the ecosystem. I still use my ancient 2013 MacBook Pro, and I‚Äôm impressed by its longevity. The recent announcements at WWDC21 provoked me to think about why I use the company‚Äôs products, so I thought I‚Äôd post here to ask what others reasons are, too.   With iOS 15 around the corner, Apple is telling what I think is quite a profound story of technology increasingly blurring boundaries between devices. So is seamless connectivity what means so much to its users? Or is the product design? Many of the features of iOS aren‚Äôt the most innovative, at least at a high level (for example, Google Lens has been able to do what Live Text will soon be able to for a while now, as tech journalists and commentators have pointed out). So it is the quality of the software that appeals instead? Or is it because of habit? Or: is it all of the above, or entirely different reasons that I haven‚Äôt even hinted at?

I'm wondering if this is just me, but when something happens where I know I will imminently get a notification, I feel anxiety up until that notification occurs.

For example, when washing my hands, I feel tense until the Watch vibrates to say it's detected I've started washing my hands - they actually changed this behaviour in an update thankfully.   However where I've enabled the Watch to unlock apps and my Mac, I also notice when I get a Touch ID prompt, I get this horrible anxious feeling for the second or two between seeing that Touch ID prompt and my Watch vibrating to offer me to double-tap to auth the action.

"[Promo Sunday] Cornhole Buddy, the advanced cornhole stat and score keeper. Hey all!   I posted here a few weeks ago, but after making some tweaks with the UI, I'm posting again now that I'm happy with where the app is.   I developed Cornhole Buddy because I felt like there was a huge gap in the market for players. Casual players can use this as well as advanced, but cornhole has made such leaps and bounds in the last few years in popularity that there is a need for a way for players to keep track of more than just score.   As of now, you can track scores, track dozens of stat categories over different time intervals, play against AI, play with friends over bluetooth to track stats through one device, track your Dekaround score, and more. I'm hoping in the future to add a bracket generator based on everyone's skill level as well.  If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment or PM me. Thanks everyone! The app is FREE to download, but I do offer a premium version for players looking to keep track of their stats over time, other than just the stats I offer at the end of each game.   [ ",apple

"I made an app that generates full-body motion capture animations using ARKit - MobileCap [   When I saw the body tracking functionality that Apple added to ARKit 3.0, I immediately thought that it would be great in an app to create animation files. I couldn't find any that did that, so I made my own!  Instead of buying an expensive and cumbersome motion capture suit, or tediously animating by hand, record 3D animations with nothing more than your iOS device! Powered by ARKit, MobileCap allows for full body 14-point tracking in real time from your device's camera. Once you've completed a capture, make refinements with a comprehensive set of export options, preview your adjustments in the app, and then export the capture as an FBX animation file that can be used in all common 3D modeling programs and game engines.  As a game developer myself with very little 3D animation experience, I use the app to generate humanoid animations for my games. Now, instead of spending hours manually animating a rig, I can record one in seconds. I demoed an early TestFlight build here on Reddit earlier this year and got a lot of great feedback, and now that it's finally out, I plan to continue updating the app as long as people find it useful!

"MagSafe charger has stopped working on my iPhone 12 Pro. Hi everyone, I am hoping people smarter than me on this subreddit can help diagnose the problem I am already having with the MagSafe charging. I have a iPhone 12 pro, new silicone case, and the MagSafe puck charger - everything is obviously brand new, no drops, no water exposure, nothing.  I put my phone on the charger this morning and boom, no charging (case on and case off). I put an old iPhone 10 on the charger and it charged wirelessly. When I put my silicone case on my phone, the MagSafe circle sensor appears on the screen. The 12 charges through the USB-C just fine.  So it seems the problem is the phone, but I find it strange that the MagSafe in the phone still recognizes the case. I'm likely headed to the Apple store tomorrow, but wanted to see if this is an isolated problem or if anyone has ideas that haven't popped into my head. I did read that the MagSafe sometimes will not charge if you are less than 80% - the phone was around half charge.  What a bummer.",apple

an iPad's durability I have proudly  owned my iPad Air 2 since freshmen year of high school (now a sophomore in college) and I can say it is still one of my favorite devices from apple. I truly did not think an iPad's durability would be so great. Yes my iPad is not compatible with an apple pencil but the Adonis dash 3 is the best stylus for what I need to get done (writing notes &amp; making small doodles). I can honestly say I probably will never upgrade unless it completely shuts down (but I dont see that happening because even the battery life is still pretty darn good). I am just curious on some of y'alls thoughts on the overall usage and durability on an iPad and wanted to see if anyone else is repping the iPad Air 2,apple

"Should ‚Äòportrait oriented‚Äô iPhone apps on larger sized iPads, be allowed to display vertically, while in landscape? The screen space is there. I can‚Äôt be the only one that this bothers. When opening any non-optimized iPhone built apps on the iPad Pro, it forces the rotation into portrait. So if you‚Äôre docked or something your iPad displays it sideways. So you either have to crane your neck or undock/rotate the iPad.  I feel this limitation is unnecessary, at least on the larger screened iPad devices, as there is adequate space.   Anyone else?",apple
"What are everyone's experiences with asking Apple to repair vintage devices? Basically, I have an 8 GB iPod Touch 3rd generation that, from what I can tell, is still supported on Apple's website. Now, the iPod itself has a broken home button, and I was wondering what would happen if I sent it in. Has anyone tried sending in a vintage product? Would they just repair the thing, or would they send me a brand new one for the same exact price as a home button replacement? I'd do it myself, but iPod touches are known to be a pain to fix and have a ton of adhesive, and the idea of me getting a newer iPod if they don't have the part in stock sounds appealing to me. The fact that their website said it's still supported (I live in California) is promising. Has anyone ever tried this? What were the results?",apple
"TouchKey - Send keyboard shortcuts to any app from the TouchBar or menu bar I've created [TouchKey](  a small app that allows you to send any configurable keyboard shortcut to running apps or Safari tabs.  How do I use it? In this time working from home, I found myself conferencing with different apps through the day, mainly a combination of Zoom, Slack, and Google Meet. I wanted the ability to quickly mute the microphone when any of these was in the background, so TouchKey was born.  There are alternatives: I've tried Mutify or Mic Drop, and both work great by actually muting the microphone on your Mac. But I like my peers in the conference room to have the feedback and know I'm muted. This is how the idea was born.  TouchKey ended up being a more general approach, and can help you in other situations (if you use it, I'd love to hear how, so we can try to enhance on that).  TouchKey is no in the Mac App Store since it uses private APIs for accessibility and to insert an icon in the TouchBar. It's $5.99 after a one week trial, and you can purchase it from within the app.",apple
"Magic Mouse 2 easy switching between Windows &amp; Mac I have searched, and it looks like the one app that came up was Synergy, however I only have one monitor so this will not work for me.

Initially my 16"" MacBook Pro which I had purchased in November had developed a light spot on the display. I took my machine in and within ten minutes, my machine was inspected and given the green light to move forward with a display replacement.   Fast Forward to today, after my machine was overnighted from Houston to San Francisco, I walked in and within five minutes had my Mac back in my hands. The repair slip had noted that not only the Display had been replaced but the top case, so essentially I have a ""brand new"" computer with only the logic board and bottom plate remaining from prior to the repair. The top case had been replaced for a battery issue which I did not even know was going on.  This experience and the few I've had in the past are why I stick with Apple. Now that Microsoft Stores are sadly shuttering globally, this only cements my position to stick with Apple.

This is actually a problem I've run into for, oh I'd say about \*ten damn years,\* since Snow Leopard. When opening more than 3 or 4 RAW photo files from DSLR cameras, at once (my Nikon marks them as .NEF, my Sony as .ARW) preview will slow down, completely freeze, or otherwise seem to be working fine and suddenly crash, forcing me to open photos one-by-one.

"AppleCare double-replaced my iPhone? My iPhone broke and I did an express replacement under AppleCare.  They overnighted me a new phone, I sent them back my old phone. I was happy, everything was great.  Today, I got my original phone *back*, repaired.  The box in which it arrived did not contain return postage for the phone I have now which I would have expected if they believed I was returning a device to them.  So now I have the fully functional iPhone I was sent as part of the express replacement, AND my old one in its repaired state.  My initial concern was that they decided my phone wasn't actually broken (it was bricked, but not physically damaged) but nothing they've sent me said anything to that effect, and I didn't get a receipt for any charges.  If they determined the phone was not broken, I would expect to have seen *something* with the words ""we have determined that your phone did not need repair"" or something to that effect.  So, did I fall in to an iPhone black hole?  I'm pretty sure apple doesn't ""lose"" phones... But they have sent me two working phones, and I have already sent them back my broken one.  What should I do?",apple

Showing developers the features and roadmap for release. And also how easy porting iOS apps will be using Catalyst.  Then over the coming months, Apple will work with big developers like Adobe, Microsoft and some game companies to build/port some ARM apps of their big programs. Culminating to a March 2021 presentation where they will show off all these new third party developer apps that are working on the ARM Mac demonstrating the support and strength of an ARM Mac.

I'd love to know how to change the default name for a bluetooth device.  The example I'll use is my JBL speaker. If I pair it to my MacBook, I can change its nickname from ""JBL Flip Essential"" to ""obri95's JBL Flip Essential."" But when I connect the speaker to my iPhone, it's still called ""JBL Flip Essential.""  Is there a way I can go into the root of the device to change the default pairing name? So that wherever the device shows up, it has the personal name I've given it? eg. If a friend wanted to use the speaker, it would show up as ""obri95's JBL Flip Essential.""  I don't even know where to start with this or if it's even possible. I'm assuming every device would be different depending on the manufacturer and model.",apple
"Why can‚Äôt I make a text message be marked as unread after it has been read, like I can with an email that has been read? In my iPhone, when I receive a text message or an iMessage, once I have opened it, I cannot mark it as unread to mark it as a reminder to come back to, nor do they come with any calendar or reminder app functionalities.  I called Apple and asked why this was not possible and I was transferred to a half dozen senior employees who each gave me answers as though I was asking the moon from Apple.

"LG 34WK95U monitor on MacBook Pro 15"" (Mid 2015)? Hello everyone! üôÇ  I have a question that I have not managed to solve after several days looking everywhere ... And if I have found people who asked this same question but never got a clear answer or simply did not get any.  The question is that I am considering buying the [LG 34WK95U-W](  monitor, but it is not clear to me if it will work well on my [MacBook Pro 15-inch (Mid 2015)](  Official compatibility is from the 2016 MacBook Pro, but From what I have read Apple in some of the latest versions of MacOS X has improved the compatibility with monitors. In the end from what I have been reading, my MacBook to support two monitors at 3840x2160 each, technically could support a single monitor at 5120 x 2160 connecting the two Thunderbolt ports to the monitor, but I find it a bit strange that this is possible, if it would be with an adapter or how it should be done.  Well thank you very much and I hope someone can help me üôÇ  Greetings to all!",apple
"Airport tech support request - assigning static IPs over Ethernet So I have a new network at home, an Airport Express is my main router in my garage where my ISP's connection is and I have 2x AirPort Express' and a Time Capsule extending that network backhauled over Ethernet.  I've got a 48 port cat6 ethernet switch in the mix with everything that could be on Ethernet on it to keep traffic off the WiFi network.  Why Airports?  I had a lot of them and it's handy to be able to stream AirPlay 2 too.  What I want to do:  Only allow DHCP addresses from x.x.x.100-x.x.x.254, and assign static IPs using DHCP reservations to anything below that using Mac addresses to identify.  What I can't figure out:  If I assign a static IP to something under 100 using a DHCP will it work as I've told the Airport that DCHP should only be given out for addresses 100 and above?  Following up from that, can I assign a static IP via DHCP reservation over Ethernet or is it WiFi only?  The AirPort Utility doesn't make this clear.",apple

"MacBook Pro. Should I wait? Basically the title. I‚Äôm a recent high school graduate and was looking into getting a MacBook Pro for when I go off to college. I am specifically looking at the 16 inch MacBook Pro and although I get a 200 dollar deal on any Mac product since I‚Äôm a student, I was wondering if I should wait until fall. The reason I was thinking this is because I want to wait and see if apple releases a new MacBook around the fall time, or even add slight updates to the 16 inch. So I came here to ask if there is news of a new MacBook Pro release or a refresh, or even update. I just want to get the newest one possible before I go off so I‚Äôm sure it can last me for several years onward. Moreover, I was wondering if I should also wait to see if the 200 dollar student deal becomes more enticing. In the past they usually throw in a free pair of beats and I was wondering that if I wait until fall, will they bring up the deal to throw in free beats again or not? Please help me make the right decision if I should wait. Thank you",apple

"Did anything happen to safari lately? What is going on? I always prefer safari and Apple's approach for a lean, efficient and fast web instead of trying to bloat it. To me, Safari has been the best browser for years, and companies that release web apps as ""native"" and websites only tested for chrome don't look good to me.  Anyway, I used some websites that didn't even work with Firefox, like my ISPs streaming site. I also tried Spotify on the browser. It's my understanding that both of these websites didn't work with safari at all and only started to work on firefox after they bundled the closed code of Google's retarded DRM.  So these websites were dependent on that retarded DRM and were only tested for Chrome. Bu in the last few days...  Both websites have been working on Safari? What? How? Why? What happened?  This means that now Spotify on Safari uses like a trillion times less resource than their *app*/eletron garbage?

"Hey guys, I just made an app where you can learn to create iOS apps interactively ! Since many of you guys like Apple products, you might be interested in making apps for iOS.  This app will interactively teach you SwiftUI, a very recent UI toolkit used to design iOS apps super easily.  &amp;#x200B;  As a SwiftUI learner, I wanted to develop some sort of medium where its users can actively experiment with SwiftUI instead of simply reading the code and looking at screenshots.  Actively interacting with SwiftUI is possible only on Apple platforms, so it is not achievable on most websites or Android devices because Swift cannot run in such environments.  And that is why I have decided to make an iOS app for this purpose!  &amp;#x200B;  This app is free and there are no ads whatsoever.  While I'm not an advanced iOS developer by any means, I really wish this app would serve its functions and assist its users to learn some SwiftUI!  &amp;#x200B;  I'm definitely planning to update it by continuously improving and adding more topics in the future as I take into account all of your suggestions!                                      for any kind of feedback!  Lastly, please remember to stay safe during this global pandemic!  &amp;#x200B;  Link to this app on App Store:  [ ",apple

I can‚Äôt use cloud gaming PC service Shadow, I can‚Äôt use Stadia, I can‚Äôt use parsec, I can‚Äôt use GeForce Now, I can‚Äôt use xcloud properly the list goes on and on and it‚Äôs all because of Apple greedy policy of wanting 30% of game purchases when they are doing nothing for it!

"AirPods and Xbox Wireless Standard Background: Xbox uses a propriety wireless standard that has much lower latency and interference as compared to standard Bluetooth, and for this reason most Bluetooth headsets (including AirPods don‚Äôt work with it) are not able to be paired with an Xbox. Microsoft has given the tech to some gaming headset makers who offer wireless headsets. And there is a pretty large desire for AirPods to work with Xbox for game audio and chat purposes.   Very specific type of question, but given this, what are the chances that Apple receives (or even seeks out) permission to incorporate this standard and implements it in their future wireless head/earphones-specifically the AirPods?",apple

"The notch is actually genius Think about if there was no notch.  50% of the time you would pick up your phone with the camera at the bottom instead of the top and have to flip it.  Just think about all the time we've saved and how annoying it is to use a USB cable and get it wrong half the time.  Imagine if every USB cable just had a little notch to let you know which way was right, relief!  Having the phone only have a single ""right way up"" also ensures the facial recognition camera is always at eye level and the right way up for scanning, making scans faster.  If the iPhone had to scan at chin level it would take longer to recognise you and give more errors because it can't get a complete picture at the angle and with your chin blocking your face.  For this reason I think the notch is intentional by Apple and will not be going away in any future iPhones.  IMO The iPhone will always have something to use as an indicator of ""this is up"" on it (old iPhones had a home button for the same purpose).  And for now, with the removal of the home button, that is the notch.  Will 2021 iPhone still have a notch?",apple

"Catalina - No longer can have separate encrypted boot drive password at boot before any user can login?

But I've always preferred having a separate boot drive decryption password that needs to be entered by the device owner before any users can even log in.  It seems more secure this way.  Can I still mimic this by creating an admin account that uses my desired long boot drive decryption password and for subsequent users created (an everyday user account for myself, a guest account, etc), remove them from having permissions to unlock the boot drive?

"Unpopular opinion: The authentic Milanese loop works worse than a knockoff one I bought when the series 0 came out. The authentic loop creases wherever it bends, which I understand is probably because of the tighter weave that allows the band to stand up better on its side better than the knockoff. I feel like the lack of creasing is more satisfying to me, because while the authentic feels sturdier on its side, the knock off still manages to do a decent job without creasing. The authentic has a worse overall fit than the knockoff, leaving a red mark on my skin when I have them adjusted to the exact same tensions. The authentic pulls so much more hair than the knockoff. I cant even wipe the sweat off of my forehead, scratch my head, or run my hands through my hair without pulling my hair every time. Also pulls my arm hair way more on the knockoff. I appreciate the price drop to $100 for the authentic Milanese loop from Apple and I had purchased the knock off band from Best Buy when the series 0 was the newest watch from Apple.",apple
"Any auto upload to icloud &amp; remove from gallery The icloud is very confusing, I turned it on hoping it was going to upload photo.

I was shocked to see this old picture on my brand new iPhone 11 that I got. I had no idea how it got in. But I found out it was because of icloud, and manage to prove my GF (by show dato on the photo) that was added, it was years old picture before we and her.

Specifically, the following fields are required but do not appear to be directly relevant to your app‚Äôs core functionality:   \-Gender   \-Bank accounts  Just to be clear, the app doesn't ask the gender of users, it only asks them which avatar they want to pick.

"Rethinking iOS Architecture and Testing with SwiftUI Lunch and Learn on May 1 Join Def Method for a Lunch &amp; Learn on Friday May 1 exploring how SwiftUI and related developments on iOS make it possible to rethink iOS app architecture. SwiftUI is Apple‚Äôs new, unified framework for building interfaces across all of its platforms using Swift. It also enables new app architectures in the post-Objective-C era.  During this free workshop led by Principal Engineer Paul Ort, we'll explore how SwiftUI and related developments on iOS make it possible to (1) combine the benefits of programmatic views and visual layouts, (2) apply a declarative UI paradigm popularized by React, (3) and make testing (historically an aspect of iOS development that has lagged behind web development) an stronger part of iOS architecture, in order to build mobile apps with greater confidence.

The price point of iPhone(2020) is good, but if you don't look at the gift card/50% off discounts and just look at the MSRP, the iPhone SE 128GB and 256GB are way more expensive than the used iPhone X 256GB at the moment.

Same thing for open source community that cannot thrive on ios because people want to add their own compiled open source apps themselves, a bit ridiculous for a privacy conscious platform.  How about downgrading ? Look at the airpods pro situation now, in the quest of magical updates and seamless experience we now have a lesser product and can't do anything about it.

"Apple Shipments, How Much Could It Fall Amid Coronavirus Outbreak?  Without a doubt, the COVID-19 pandemic has roiled equity markets. And the downtrend trajectory that started in late February might extend further in the near term as governments continue to take stocks of the economic impact of the outbreak. Some countries have closed their borders and announced lockdowns. Thus, consumers are spending less on non-essential goods and services and delaying purchases. Then, they expect this to hit the top line of a few companies by a significant margin. A tech giant, set to face a considerable drop in revenue, is Apple. The firm makes the majority of its flagship product, the iPhone. Last December quarter, iPhone sales increased by 7.7% to $56.0 billion and accounted for 61% of overall revenue. With that, the demand for the company's new lineup of smartphones mainly driven the growth. However, on February 17, Apple unveiled a statement confirming that the firm will miss the quarterly guidance issued during the last earnings call. Also, Apple attributed the shortfall to a constrained iPhone supply and a slow production ramp-up in its manufacturing sites in China. These headwinds have the capacity to depress Apple's results beyond the current quarter.      To read the full article click the link:   [ ",apple

"Maybe Apple should apply their contactless ApplePay wizardry to the lowly doorknob Covid-19 is showing the benefit (and need) for contactless solutions. Which will likely persist after this pandemic dies down.  It never occurred to me how often we actually touch door knobs (just like it never really occurred how often we touch our faces). And we touch them at two significant germ transmission points‚Äîentering our homes (after our hands have been out in the world), and getting into and out of bathrooms:     Many newer cars have moved to ‚Äúkeyless‚Äù entry (although you still have to lift the door handle). So imagine using your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock and pop open doors for (mostly) touch-free entry.  Huge ApplePay fan here. I‚Äôm sure Apple is already thinking about the contactless future.

"Is a 7.5 watt wireless charger better for battery health vs 18 watt fast charger? I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and in my head, I figure it would be better to charge it slowly with a wireless charger than the included fast charger and save the fast charging for emergency situations. I've heard using a fast charger is painful for batteries, however I've also heard that the excess heat with the wireless charger can be harmful. I've never really experienced my phone, even with a case on, that charging wirelessly to be ""hot"" or even fairly warm to the touch.   Another thought I have is that the longer a battery is between 20 - 80% the better. I've heard that the health of a battery can be effected in the charging range between 0 - 20% and 80-100%.  Now I know it's not the biggest deal, and apple (as well as other companies) do a good job of making the necessary tweaks in software to prevent the degradation of the battery.

AirPods Pro only for music/yt?! So i really like my AirPods Pro for music on my iPhone and the occasionally youtube Video. That seems to work fine.  Now i tried to use them for some voice apps like discord or a 3d world learning platform. And the AirPods seem not to like them. I get a static murmur when one of these Apps start and cant hear anything or the audio quality is really bad. Mic is really bad too.  Thats both while paired to a surface 7 pro. The internet is full of these problems with AirPods and voice apps for years but no fixes.  &amp;#x200B;  Is that a known problem between non-apple and apple products? if i use my wired earpods with the surface 7 pro everything works fine.

"I made an app to track your time and see where it goes. Feedback appreciated!  Hi everyone!  I've always wondered what all my time is spent doing. Every time I set out to complete a task, it always takes me more time than I expect, even though I feel like I've been working hard nonstop. I started using notecards to track my time spent working, and found out that over 50% of my time is wasted! But using notecards was such a hassle, and I couldn't view any in-depth statistics. So, I created an app to track time.  The basic premise of the app is that you create categories and use a timer to keep track of how much time you spent on each category. The timer does not run in the background, so leaving the app in the background does not drain the battery. You can also use the app as a planner, and you can add in assignments and events, with alarms to alert you.  The app is **completely free** and all data is **locally stored**.

The only difference between the two models is that the pros have silicone tips that go into your ears and create a seal. Additionally they have active noice cancellation that blocks ambient noise. Are these additions likely to cause significant hearing damage compared to regular AirPods? Thanks.,apple

"I made an app to track your time and and see where it goes. Feedback appreciated! Hi everyone!  I've always wondered what all my time is spent doing. Every time I set out to complete a task, it always takes me more time than I expect, even though I feel like I've been working hard nonstop. I started using notecards to track my time spent working, and found out that over 50% of my time is wasted! But using notecards was such a hassle, and I couldn't view any in depth statistics. So, I created an app to track time.  The basic premise of the app is that you create categories and use a timer to keep track of how much time you spent on each category. The timer does not run in the background, so leaving the app in the background does not drain battery. You can also use the app as a planner, and you can add in assignments and events, with alarms to alert you.  The app is **completely free** and **all data is locally stored.** There is no signup: we do not take any emails or passwords.  Any and all feedback is appreciated!   **App link**: [ ",apple

I did find one that gets the Install Sierra app, but won't work apparently due certificate issues (it says it is damaged). There is also a dmg that opens to an InstallOS pkg, but that appears to go straight to installing with no app access. So none of the instructions found online will get me to setting up a boot able thumb drive. Solutions?",apple

"iCloud two-factor verification same device I'm getting a weird situation on my macbook and iPhone.  Basically, every few weeks either device will ask me to re-input my password for iCloud and then require two-factor verification.  Mildly annoying, but no biggee for extra security.  The weird part is that the 6 digit code will pop up on both devices, no matter which one I'm trying to log in with.  For example, just now I was accessing my iCloud from my macbook and it required two-factor verification.  The 6-digit code literally popped up on my computer screen to be inputted into the iCloud website on my computer...the same happens with my phone (and yes, my phone had the same 6-digit code as the computer just now).  Is this normal, or is there a way to prevent what seems like an error?  Just seems to basically defeat the purpose of two-factor identification if the code is given to the device being used.  Obviously they would still need my password, but would like two-factor verification to work correctly if possible.",apple

(I don't even know what this means since my iPhone synced everything to iCloud and my photos aren't actually downloading on my Mac since I can already see them in the photos app. I don't know if it syncs or something.) However since this is an extremely long process and it just ""downloads"" a few 100 at a time, I need to keep the Photos app awake while it ""downloads"". Otherwise it stops. However, I don't want to deal with a display burn in just because iCloud decides it needs to be slower than a turtle. Does anyone here have a solution for this problem?  I'm using a 2019 MacBook Air if it helps. And yes I got a really good wifi connection. My problem is not the speed. My problem is a possible display burn in. Thanks in advance for any answer",apple

"Help with MacBook Pro 2019/2020 model So I currently own a MacBook Pro 13 2019, 2.4Ghz Laptop and I just realized that the new one is coming out in half a year or less. I am just wondering if I should get a refund and wait for this year's model or to stick with the one I currently own. The only things that is bothering me with this current laptop is that there is no escape key and that the screen glitches when turning off. It is supposedly so with all 2019 models so the Apple store couldn't do a thing about it. I genuinely love the keyboard on this model way more than the one on the 16 inch. I know its not normal but that's just the way I roll. I want to start learning coding and video editing so that's why I thought that I might go with the supposedly stronger 2020 models.

"Screen on time Mac OS Catalina 10.15.3 shows picture of Facebook friend Hi  I have this very strange and in my opinion scary issue. After the Catalina update, I went and checked my settings on my Macbook Pro. In the settings I pressed 'screen on time' to see my usage (I use this a lot on my iPhone XR).   I saw my name on the top in the left which is 'Simon'. Suddenly the picture loaded and I didn't recognised it until I got a closer look. It's a picture of one of my Facebook-friends who's name is also Simon! See printscreen I added.  To be clear: this 'Simon' is in no way associated with this Macbook Pro. So before anyone asks: no I don't have this picture saved on my Mac, no he doesn't have a login on this Mac and no he has never used this Mac ever. (I haven't talked to him in the last 10 years or so)  This is extremely unsettling: how is it possible that a picture of one of my Facebook-friends (that picture is not even his profile pic but one where he's tagged in) is used on my Macebook Pro when I check my screen time.

Dear Apple. How much longer? Two problems I've had since iOS 13/iPadOS. Neither is a common problem but they just happen to affect my two main interests.  1. A bug in the Shortcuts app that stops the Speak Text action from running in the background (OSStatus error 560557684). This means I can't use my Shortcuts routine to listen to and learn Italian sentences while running every day. Not much fun after building and using this system for over three years.   2. Someone apparently decided to change the thumbnail display for videos in the Photos app. Now the 400+ travel and memories videos I've made over nearly a decade no longer display the first frame as a thumbnail (which I always set with a big title). The new thumbnail is usually no use at all for identifying most videos.  Ok. Nobody is talking about either of these issues so they probably aren't a big issue for you Apple or anybody else (yes they have been reported). I'm just sad that my two biggest interests seem to have been derailed for the last four months. Four months! And I'm really worried they won't ever be fixed.,apple

"Ipad Pro 10.5 Keeps Powering Off Looking for suggestions on how to handle this situation. I have a 10.5 inch Ipad Pro that has been an awesome tool for work. I only use it for presentations and taking notes (nothing personal). Randomly last week it started powering off randomly while I was using it. I then did the software update thinking this would fix the problem, It didn't. I brought it in to apple and they told me that it was not a ""Software"" issue but instead a ""Hardware"" issue. I then assumed they would warranty the ipad and or fix it. He told me that there was nothing they could do and offered me the option to trade in my partially working ipad and pay $480 for another one (Which I can get online at that price and still keep mine?)  With this being said, how do I go about this situation? I would stick with apple however I will not buy a new one if it will only last me two years. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is there any way to get them to warranty it or at least get a new one for cheaper?",apple

"MacBook Pro 13"" 2015 DIY Upgrade I own a MacBook Pro 13"" 2015 i5 2.7gHz with 8gb ram. Everything works just fine without issues, but I am not happy with the performance I get out of it.

"iPhone stolen - appleid compromised Good evening everyone, I have a nightmare story and I seek advice.  On friday my phone was stolen although I reported it stolen and asked iCloud to erase device I believe my passcode was somehow guessed, which led to all my passwords from google password manager (which I didn't even know existed) being leaked and the passwords from my google and apple accounts being changed. I also had all my bank account balance sent to a strangers account.   I have already recovered the accounts and changed all the relevant passwords that were compromised and ""blacklisted"" the passwords that were stored in google's service. IMEI is already blacklisted by the carrier.  As my passcode has been compromised, all my data is in possession of someone I don't know and even though find my iphone has been turned off and icloud has been logged out I still can see it on my apple id account's settings page.  Is there anyway I can ""brick"" that iPhone? As to stop the possibility of identity theft...   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  if anyone cares for more detail I can provide..",apple

"Exchanging an iphone at Apple while on ATT contract So I bought an iphone 11 recently and decided I wanted to exchange it for an iphone 11 pro. I ran into issues getting an upgrade reversal through ATT and now it's past the 14 day grace period.

"How to make AirPod Pros more comfortable! I am one of those people that really loved the original airpods for their fit. When I got these new ones, I was bummed they didn‚Äôt fit like the originals.   It wasn‚Äôt until later that I realized this VERY important detail:  When you use larger tips, the earbuds push out of your ear canal. This can place pressure on the cartilage of your outer ear. The solution? Try the smallest tips.   I overlooked the small tips because I never assumed my ear holes were small, but I find (with the small tips) the AirPod Pros sit in my ears very similar to the previous generation AirPods.   When you get the right tips, it almost feels like a sealed version of the last generation pods!  Moral of the story ‚Äî if you feel pressure, try a smaller tip. This might be obvious, but hopefully it is helpful to some!",apple
"Purchasing AppleCare+ from country where it's not available I've purchased a Macbook Pro 16"" and would like to purchase the AppleCare as well (it's still less than 60 days old), but I live in a country where the AppleCare is not being sold officially - we do have local Apple authorized service providers that honor AppleCare. I also have a friend in Canada who could buy it online for me (using his Apple ID), does anybody have any experience with this? I'm mainly interested in these points:  1. Is it even possible to obtain the AppleCare this way? 2. Apple says you need to run a remote diagnostic tool - does this tool require you to log in with the Apple ID that's used to purchase the AppleCare? If not, how is the result of the diagnostic sent to Apple? 3. Apple says you can transfer your AppleCare rights to another party - now since my friend would be the buyer, would they have to transfer the rights to me in order for me to have my Macbook serviced, or does Apple only care whether the AppleCare has been activated or not?",apple

"3D Touch is still on iPhones (kinda) Happened to notice something while using Gboard with my iPhone 11 Pro.   When you long press on the space bar but barely touch it, it takes a while to go into moving the text cursor. When pressing it using a higher surface area of your thumb, the process is a little quicker, and feels almost like 3D Touch.    I think it works by measuring how much of the screen you're touching and that's pretty cool since your thumb tend to cover more surface area when you press down harder.

"5+ Hours in the ""Transfer my MP3 Audiobooks to an Apple Watch App"" Hole and I'm going steadily insane I'm one of those weirdos who uses spoken word to exercise, and from a long history of library usage, CD Ripping, and Librivox obsession, I'm in a position where I'm tearing what's left of my hair out trying to solve a problem I hope isn't exclusive to me.

They also don't allow long extensions to pay it all back, and I just get paid a very small amount since I work in retail that barely gives me hours.   I'm just still upset and baffled at the scam of ""trade-in programs"" that Apple and carriers have that really just mean ""you can borrow money then have to give it back"" instead of actually getting the trade-in amount for the phone I paid for in full price when I got it.

"Why does the IPad Pro features USB-C and the other devices don‚Äôt? With the new iPhone very likely to keep the lightning port and all other iPad and accesories using it also, the question I have is why did Apple decided to put USB-C in the Pro versions of Ipads in the first place?  At the beginning, everyone thought this was Apple first step in massive migration of every device to USB-C. But as time passes, this theory started to fall apart.  The other theory: leaving USB-C to the Pros, also fails because for once, the IPhone Pro fails the test and also because it may be a bad move to Apple to ‚Äúadmit‚Äù lightning is worse because only Pro devices use USB-C.  Frankly, I think Apple doesn‚Äôt have a master plan on this.

"A rant, and why I think right to repair really needs to be a thing. As insane as it was a bit over 2 years ago, I bought an iPhone X. Love the phone, no regrets about the tech itself. I purchased the phone thinking ""I'm going to keep this for more than two years"".  Fast forward to about 26 months later and my battery is in the mid-80%. I'm good with the phone, so I decide to pull the trigger on a battery replacement. I set up an appointment at Best Buy (the closest authorized service center). I mention I have some lightning issues (believe it or not, it would only charge with a cable in one direction).  Arrive at my appointment and I'm told ""Sorry, we can't put a battery in the phone because the lightning port isn't 100%"". Apparently the service tool could brick my phone if the lightning port isn't functional, AND... they can't swap the lightning ports on the iPhone X. I was told to ""buy a new phone"".  This is insane... I order a battery off iFix it and do the swap myself, but (as you might expect), the battery has some intelligence so my phone no longer tells me the status of the battery (outside of the % charge).",apple

"Macbook Advice - Should I Upgrade? Hello! I recently was given a MacBook Pro 13"" 2017 model, no Touch Bar + 256gb SSD, with &lt;50 battery cycles for $500. My current everyday laptop is an early 2015 13"" MBP 128gb. Initially, I planned to sell the new one and make a quick \~$500-600 profit off of it -- but now, I am wondering if I should just snag it for myself. Not being able to charge and still have two ports does bug me, but the only actual port I will be missing is the built-in HDMI. What do you guys think? Should I keep the older and make the profit, or keep the newer and try to cover the $500 with the older one?  Add: Though I don't intend to make my decision strictly off of this, I did compare League on both machines and the newer one gets about twice as much frames as the older (60 -&gt; 120 fps). This is the main reason for making the post, because I could not believe that there was such a large performance increase on a relatively similar-specced machine (if anyone knows why this might be happening I would love to know).

So I reseted Face ID and remake it and it couldn't recognize my face because the camera was blurry from the moisture. than the phone started flickering. It wouldn't turn the screen off and sometimes green lines would appear. Right now I put it in a bag of rice because I have no silica Gell and this happened at night so no repair shops are open.  What should I do and what should I expect in terms of repairs?",apple
"Quick, probably dumb question about Sharing my movie library. Okay so,  I‚Äôm obviously not an expert on this stuff at all, but I just had a quick question. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible (or even legal?), but I‚Äôve been building a nice Apple Library of movies I love, and I wanted to know if it‚Äôs possible to give a couple friends access to it. Preferably where I don‚Äôt just give them my password (if that would even work).  I know there‚Äôs Family Sharing, but I don‚Äôt have family that would understand it or care. I do have two friends on the other hand that I‚Äôd love to be able to share with.   Person 1: I tried sending a Family Sharing link but I guess it didn‚Äôt work because she‚Äôs already registered as being in a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù with her son on her account.   Person 2: I‚Äôll be honest he‚Äôs on Android and I don‚Äôt have a clue what the hell‚Äôs going on over there. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd download an Apple app on his tv if it would work.   Is it okay to do? Is it possible? If so could I get some tips on how to do it, considering the problems mentioned above? And if not, well, just damn I guess.   Either way thanks for the help!",apple

"Is privacy more important than saving lives? Apple has once again taken its stand on privacy, refusing to unlock an iPhone related to the Florida shooting case. From a business model perspective, that makes total sense. They advocate greatly for privacy, so it's a great way to get some positive marketing out there.  But why, from a moral perspective, does this make any sense? If you where related to one of the victims, wouldn't you want the authorities to do everything in their power to get as much information as possible and maybe prevent future attacks from happening? If that means creating a backdoor into the OS that might or might not fall into the hands of others, do you care?  I'm just trying to understand that point of vue . What is the worst that can happen if Apple decided to cooperate and create a backdoor? I for one don't care. The authorities can have my phone because I have nothing to hide from the outside world. Whom are they targeting if not criminals? They don't care in the slightest about your life if you did nothing wrong.Privacy is a human right you say?

"Airpods need a universal EQ that can be saved and run on the hardware I've tweaked the EQ in Spotify to help adjust my Airpods in areas I think they're lacking and to my ears they sound a whole lot better now. But I can't get this to translate over to Soundcloud, or Youtube or any other music app because each app has its own settings with different parameters, and some don't have an EQ section at all.  Here are two solutions that I think would make Airpods truly amazing:  * A simple global EQ that's the same in iOS and MacOS that can be synced across iCloud that all audio from any app passes through  * An Airpods specific EQ profile that can be saved to, and run on the Airpods hardware which would mean you can connect to any device and still have the curve applied.

"Possible Feature on iPhones? Alright, so just to start things off, full disclosure: I am just a teenager who supports Apple who wants this feature.  Okay, so I'm sure some of you must have seen the link about the macOS Catalina beta feature of a Pro Mode. (Here's the link, for anyone who hasn't :[  And so that got me thinking.   Apple claims, on their iPhone 11 Pro page, that they themselves are still trying to catch up with what their chip can do. Now, I don't know much about economics or lawsuits, or anything like that. But with that said, Apple should theoretically have no excuse for not giving the same software features which this year's group of iPhones has to the 11s. They could add more photography features, or add whatever Apple is doing. They could add the rumored Pro mode, with the same warning about loss of battery life. This could potentially open up a whole new world of possibilities, and this time, Apple themselves have said that their chips are good enough to accommodate extra features.  Obviously I may be wrong about certain parts, and if so, I would like to know in the comments. What are your thoughts on this concept?",apple

I contacted support to get the charges reversed, they told me since the account had outstanding charges I had to update the payment method to process refunds.  So I did.  They charged me more.  Then they told me they wouldn't refund.  I've had better customer experiences with the cable company.  Any ideas on recourse?",apple

"Macbook Air (base) $799 vs Macbook Pro (base w/256GB SSD) $1249 Hello to all,  Long time reddit reader...first time poster.

If you had the opportunity to return the Air and get the Pro with 256GB SSD, would you pay the additional $450 for: better processor, slightly better screen, touch bar, double the SSD space, better speakers.

"My iPhone 11 Pro's port isn't grounded properly? Options? Got an iPhone 11 pro right before Thanksgiving, and I noticed it did something weird when I plugged it in to a docking station via aux cord + dongle: It kept skipping forward the song a little bit at a regular interval, and then siri kept turning on.  I brushed it off as just something weird with the plug (which doesn't make too much sense).    Just now, I had it plugged in again, and I noticed that when I touch the edge of the phone, the speakers get an interference sound similar to when you hold the end of a cable.  Similarly, I had my forearm slightly touching the edge of the phone, and I felt a small shock (You can do this with a connected aux cord too.  It's a very small shock, but it happens since such a small contact point builds potential better).   This implies that some of the electricity from the aux is going to other parts of the phone (Which would explain how it turned Siri on.  I guess the phone figured the button was being pressed).

Among other things, he was told Salesforce needed an ‚Äúapplication ecosystem‚Äù. Steve said Marc needed to figure out what that would look like.!&lt;                          and register the trademark for ‚ÄúApp Store‚Äù. However, he soon got feedback from customers that they hated the name. Instead, they called their product AppExchange.!&lt;  &gt;!Then in 2008 when Steve announced the ‚ÄúApp Store‚Äù on stage, Marc and his team were shocked - somehow they‚Äôd both independently arrived at the same name. However, wanting to thank him for the advice years early, Marc pulled Steve aside after the event and said he would be happy and honored to sign over the domain and trademark rights for free.!&lt;",apple
"What is Apple‚Äôs UX pattern? As someone who migrated to Apple‚Äôs ecosystem from Windows/Android, I found so many things weird but super intuitive at the same time.  In MacOS for example, uninstalling apps by just moving them to the Bin. In Windows, it would just remove the shortcut and the program would remain installed so I was like ‚Äúno way it‚Äôs that simple‚Äù but when you think about it, it‚Äôs literally what you want to do - remove the app.  Similarly in iOS, say you want to save some file. In most systems it would be Save As but here it‚Äôs usually Share - Save to Files. I found it quite strange at first but again, it‚Äôs what I want to do. I want to ‚Äúshare‚Äù it into my files.  I‚Äôm curious if they‚Äôre just winging it and it Just Works^(TM) or if there‚Äôs a name for those design principles with a set of rules and if so, I‚Äôd like to read up on them.",apple
"Macbook Pro - Should I buy a mid-2014 model vs. late-2013 model and is the asked price alright? So, I am buying a Macbook Pro for the purpose of portable capability to do graphical design (Illustrator, Indesign, Photoshop, Premiere etc).  I have currently two options, either buying Macbook Pro mid-2014 or late-2013. Both from second-hand sellers, the second from a refurbisher. Which would you buy?  Pros and cons of each model here:  There is no internal difference outside of the fact that 2014 model has slightly better processor. Exact same specs regarding RAM and space (16GB, 256G)  The mid-2014 model: (700‚Ç¨)  \+ Perfect condition. Not even a single scratch. Great re-sell value if a need ever comes for that?  \+ Has only 340 battery cycles   \- The model is 100‚Ç¨ more expensive vs. the other model  The late-2013 model: (600‚Ç¨)  \+ Comes with a 12-month warranty, sold by a re-furbisher  \- Has 410 battery cycles - not bad, but slightly worse than the 2014 model  \- Has few ""hair scratches"" on the screen  Currently I'm leaning towards the mid-2014 model. Is the cost of 700‚Ç¨ acceptable for this model? So far as I have been comparing Macbooks it does appear to be a good price but thought about asking here first before making an investment like this.",apple

"AirPods Pro - does transparency mode allow as much outside sound in as EarPods/AirPods 2? I‚Äôm trying to decide which to get, and most important to me is being able to hear outside sound.

"Screen Time Passcode no longer working, possible fix. My wife recently asked me to set a screen time password on her 6s so she would be less addicted to her phone. I decided to reuse a PIN that I wouldn't forget (my SIM PIN). All was fine for a few days and I was able to give her additional time when needed. On Thursday she asked me to extend her time and the PIN no longer worked. A search revealed that this is a common issue in iOS 13. Her 6s is on 13.3.  We tried various methods but I wanted to avoid dodgy third party tools. The only thing that worked was creating an encrypted local backup in iTunes and restoring the phone as detailed here:    Enter iCloud details at the activation lock screen and restore your encrypted backup.

"Idea for quickly switching AirPods connection between Apple devices I frequently use an iPhone X and an iPad Pro, and I was thinking it would be nice if my AirPods automatically connected to the device I'm primarily using whenever I switched between the two devices.  To avoid unwanted switching from the first device to the second device, it could be made to only switch when certain criteria are met, like these:  1. First device's screen is off. 2. Second device's screen is on and the camera recognizes that you're looking at the screen. 3. Some kind of sound-based media (videos, music, etc) is played on the second device.  Of course, it would be best if the feature could be turned off or otherwise adjusted based on preference.  It's a pretty minor quality-of-life type of thing, but it would be much appreciated.  One of the main things that ""converted"" me from using Android products was how user-friendly Apple devices are.  A big part of that is how compatible Apple devices are with each other (AirDrop, Handoff, etc), and I supposed this would be taking a step in a similar direction.  Thoughts?",apple

I'm just really worried because I just got this laptop and I don't have the money to get it fixed or replaced by apple since the warranty is voided if there is any water damage.

"Which Macbook Pro? Second guessing myself. So I've known since basically October that Iv'e wanted to replace my iMac that has a slow HDD with a new Macbook Pro. Iv'e been looking at these devices almost everyday and have been set on the 16"" Macbook Pro. I qualify for education pricing, so I get about $250 off of the device and AppleCare. However, I'm starting to second guess myself.  With taxes and AppleCare included, It all comes out to about $2715. However, my spending budget is only $2400 - $2500. I can justify that kind of price for the work I do (video editing, programming, Blender, etc.), but my wallet is not so flexible.  After seeing my other options, I can narrow down these 3:  Base model 16"" + AppleCare - $2715  Refurb. Base model 15"" + AppleCare -  $2370  1.4ghz 13"" + 512gb + 16gb ram + AppleCare - $2170  How are refurbished products? Do you think the 13"" is fine for my main mac? Do you think the 16"" is a better value (will last longer, be a better experience, hold it's value better)? Any answers are very appreciated. Cheers!",apple

"Powerbeats Pro Device Switching Hey Everyone,  So, I just upgraded from my BeatsX to the Powerbeats pro and I have a couple of questions.  1.	The device switching from my iPhone to my iPad seems to take a lot longer than the other way around. If they're connected to my iPad it takes about a second to switch to my phone but when I switch back to my iPad it takes a good 10-12 seconds. Just curious if this is normal? I've already updated the firmware and reset them once but that hasn't made a difference. 2.	The lid of the charging case seems pretty loose when fully open. When closed it's firm and doesn't have any play but when it's full open there's definitely some front to back wiggle before it tightens when closing, side to side seems to be fine. Is this normal?  Also probably worth mentioning that this is my third pair as I've already had to exchange them twice.

Apple allows you to ‚Äútrade in‚Äù your shattered watch and get it replaced for $300, rather than the full $529. 1) do you think they have back stock of the Series 4 and will be able to give me the same model? 2) if they don‚Äôt, do you think they‚Äôll give me the Series 5 and up-charge me for it? Kinda concerned that I‚Äôm gonna get screwed over on this one.... thank you!!!!",apple

"Anyone else finding contacts detaching from their iMessage profiles? I sent an iMessage to my mother a few hours ago, which she never received. After digging around, it seemed as though her iMessage had ‚Äúdetached‚Äù itself from sending/receiving using her phone number. It was only linked to her iCloud email address, which she doesn‚Äôt use.  I walked her through setting it up again, and we got things back working after a few minutes, but it was still unclear why it happened.  Now, 3 hours later, I went to reply to a friend‚Äôs iMessage he sent me earlier today. When I tapped through to the conversation, it didn‚Äôt show his name at the top ‚Äî just his full phone number.

"Apple should bring back the headphone jack on the iPhone SE 2/9 Hear me out: if Apple is trying to appeal to people who can‚Äôt afford/won‚Äôt pay for the higher end iPhones, they probably don‚Äôt want to pay for AirPods or a lightning to 3.5mm adapter. That $9 might not seem like much to some people, but to others it could be lunch. Plus, they‚Äôre really easy to lose. Removing it in the higher end phones makes sense, but if the goal is to appeal to lower class people, bringing back the headphone jack is definitely the right way to go. Most people who can‚Äôt afford/don‚Äôt want iPhones have androids with headphone jacks, so this would be a way to lure people over.",apple

"Bad design/wasteful design If the upcoming iPhone 13 has no ports and as its being reported that it will charge by only wireless charging there is one large problem. Wireless charging requires magnetic waves to be created which in turn requires energy for that energy to be sent to the charging pad but some of this energy also gets sometimes lost in the air, so every time you would charge the iPhone 13, you would waste precious energy. Why do we always prioritize aesthetics instead of efficiency? If the new iPhone 13 works as its being reported it will be the most wasteful iPhone out of all of them, not counting how many iPhones went into official/apple care certified  ""repairs"".",apple

I feel like this isn‚Äôt a feature that‚Äôs coming anytime soon as the layout of the store has been the same since I can remember but I really wish that Apple would either integrate additional language filters so we could find films by language, other than French, or that they‚Äôd add subcategories under Foreign Films.

List of Apple improvements I noticed upgrading from 6S+ to XR 1) My trusty home button that offers some sort of tactile feedback - gone.   2) Battery percentage - gone without extra steps.   3) Headphone jack - gone.   4) Annoying privacy invading face ID - fully present and accounted for.     Naturally these improvements warranted a price upgrade.     But wait! There's more.  TIL that I cannot easily setup a backup location on iTunes with Windows - because you know - Apple knows best.  They know that my laptop might not have much space on the hard drive and that an external hard drive is just tech fantasy.  I want some of the Cali weed that Apple designers are smoking because it is obviously fucking up their memory and causing them to fix anything that's not broken.  Thank God I can still return this expensive paperweight and get a phone that's actually designed to be convenient and not just pretty.,apple

"Responding to (outdated) 1 star ratings on iOS App Store to get ppl to change their rating? Is there a trick to this? I work in the customer service department for an app. One task I'm responsible for is responding to customer reviews on the iOS App Store. One of my KPIs is to decrease the number of 1-star ratings by responding to old reviews that are 1-star. The idea being to find reviews mentioning problems that have been fixed in updates since the original review was written, and to encourage them to (ideally) update their rating to 5 stars. I've responded to a lot of 1-star ratings and haven't had much luck. Is there a trick to getting people to willingly change their rating? Would love to hear from anyone who's had success with this.

"YouTube Won't Auto-rotate I just recently switched from a Google Pixel 2 to an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I have a few annoyances with iOS as someone will when switching from Android to iOS. My biggest issue comes from YouTube. For whatever reason, whenever I lock my phone while watching a video on YouTube, and then unlock my phone the video will not rotate back to vertical; it will stay horizontal. The screen will stay like this until I rotate the phone horizontally, and then rotate it vertically again. If I keep my phone vertical it doesn't register that my phone is vertical no matter how long I wait. It is quite annoying because you have to have your phone vertical to use Face ID. Not too sure if there is any way to fix this through any type of setting but if there is would love to find out how to solve this problem.",apple
"Are Apple ethernet ports grounded for shielded patch cables? Some of the older products like the first gen Airport Express look to have obvious shielded ports based on various metal tabs inside the port.

I'm positive AppleCare help will have no clue what I'm talking about lol.  Some of the products from recent years have this FCC Compliance Statement in the information documents that hints of grounded ports:   &gt; This product was tested for FCC compliance under conditions that included the use of Apple peripheral devices and Apple shielded cables and connectors between system components. It is important that you use Apple peripheral devices and shielded cables and connectors between system components to reduce the possibility of causing interference to radios, television sets, and other electronic devices. You can obtain Apple peripheral devices and the proper shielded cables and connectors through an Apple- authorized dealer. For non-Apple peripheral devices, contact the manufacturer or dealer for assistance.  However the most recent products from the last couple years do not have this verbiage anymore.",apple

"Macbook Pro (2019) or Macbook Air (2019) I am having trouble deciding between the new Macbook Pro and Air. I am going back to school for my masters in counseling psychology so I am not needing any advanced design sort of software. I mainly will be using Word, web browsing and maybe some Netflix as well. I would like the computer to last at least 5-6 years. The new MacBook Pro is only $250.00 more than the air and what appeals to me is the quad processor. However, I am not a fan of the touch track pad and foresee that being an issue down the road if there are any problems with it and it needs replacing. While I understand the pro does not cost too much more, $250 is still $250 that could be used towards Apple Care. Any piece of advice is appreciated :) Thanks!",apple

"iPhone 8 apples best single sensor camera system? I‚Äôve had my 8 since launch, and 2 years later I have had no regrets buying it, or have been particularly enticed by new models. But my favourite part has to be the camera.       I contemplated getting the xs when it came out because I realized that Apple was definitely sticking to multiple cameras, but the rest of the phone didn‚Äôt justify it as my 8 was still blazing through iOS just fine.       But 2 years later the single camera has held up incredibly and the image quality still holds up with much newer phones and even iPhones.

"Anybody has 100% success rate with hand-off? I think I've figured it out, help me test to see if correct. Basically, there are 3 conditions:  \- Your phone screen needs to have been turned on by motion (a la the Apple watch). If it's off, it won't transfer .  \- You need to pretty much have your phone's top half touching the top panel (the phone doesn't actually activate the capacitative controls of the HomePod).  \- There seems to be a very deliberate gesture required, when bringing the phone to the HomePod. You need to swoop up and then bring it down at an 90deg angle (if you slide it in parallel to the top panel, it doesn't work).  I'm theorizing it's the up and down motion that triggers the ping for the Homepod. Can other people test and confirm/deny?

"Theory: Could the square camera bump be the new ‚Äúnotch‚Äù? I had a passing thought about the state of iPhone and how it differentiates itself in the phone market. The 2017-2019 models were iconic due to their infamous notch that basically opened the floodgates for almost every phone to have them (although iPhone wasn‚Äôt the first to use a notch, I know). But this came in and replaced the also iconic home button on every other iPhone since 2007.   Since 2020 will mark a new super cycle, and lots of leaks keep pointing to a ‚Äúnotchless‚Äù display, IF they are to be true, who knows, could the square camera bump be the new iconic feature that marks it being an iPhone?  If you look at other square camera bumps they are nowhere near as polarizing and characteristic. Most try to be subtle (Pixel 4) or symmetrical (Mate 20 Pro, I believe? Correct me if I‚Äôm getting it wrong). The iPhone‚Äôs is a different type of glass, it‚Äôs raised within a raised bump, has distinctive lenses and flashes, etc.   Just a random theory!

"PSA: Tip for those experiencing diminished AirPods battery life I have the 1st generation, original AirPods that I've owned since their release (~3 years ago as of writing).  The battery life for each AirPod has been steadily decreasing over time, down to about 1.5 hours of audio-only usage before needing a recharge in their case, which is frustratingly short.  Before throwing them away, I decided to try one last trick.  I completely reset the AirPods case (holding down the white button on the back for 10+ seconds), and re-paired them with my iPhone.  I then completely drained both AirPods down to zero, and the case itself down to zero through normal usage.  Then, I put the dead AirPods into the dead case, and charged them both up to 100%.    This combination of reset/drain/recharge seems to have re-calibrated the battery life measurement system, and they no longer die at 1.5 hours. I'm now getting double that at around 3 - 3.5 hours, which is great for such an old pair.  Hopefully this helps anybody experiencing this same thing.   Try this battery recalibration!",apple

Stealing iPhones A friend was in an Apple Store the other day for an appointment at the Genius Bar when a group came in and one of them yanked one of the display iPhones off the wire and ran out. No one reacted. Not even the staff. She said something to one of them and she was told that the phones don‚Äôt work once they get out of the store. But then she saw two of the guys come back in as she was leaving.   This started a debate with my friends. In the debate between friends. Someone said that the parts are still valuable. I just figured that Apple probably has a policy that keeps staff and customers safe and has decided it isn‚Äôt worth a confrontation. Someone else suggested that there is a demo mode that has geolocation and follows the thieves. I am not looking for a how-to for stealing iPhones but I am curious what others think happened because it does make me weary to go in the store again.,apple

"Opinions on shipping box for MacBook Pro 2019 Hello everyone,  I'm aware that the following post might be a little nitpick, but here's the deal:  So I recently ordered a MacBook Pro 2019 from Amazon which arrived double boxed from Apple, So I mean the Pretty box was inside a larger cardboard box, which then was inside the Amazon box. All in all I was pretty surprised how well the thing was packaged, regarding that I had worse experiences with Amazon. So then the unit I had turned out to suffer from Battery issues, so I returned that one and got a replacement from Amazon instead. Turns out that this time they skipped the Cardboard box from Apple and put the pretty Box inside the Amazon Box which wasn't padded very well either. So far I haven't noticed any problems with fans or any other moving parts that could have been damaged during shipping, So I'm asking for your guys' opinion on whether I should maybe contact Amazon or if the pretty Box offers enough protection. As I already said, I know it's kind of overly dramatic to think about those things when everything seems to be working fine, but the MBP was such an expensive investment, that I'm kinda concerned.

A 2nd more serious bug (which seems to have started with iOS 13.2.2) is when you try to Airplay music to a 4th gen AppleTV, the AppleTV will take over and play directly instead of doing proper Airplay, so you can't change the volume via your phone.  If you try to switch over to Airplay from your phone again (getting the Replace What's Playing on TV? message), it won't let you and bounces back to streaming directly from the AppleTV.

"Hey Apple! - The camera app should have a voice command to take a photo, when you're holding the phone in an awkward position and can't use your fingers. ""Click"" and it takes the photo. I often find myself struggling to take one-handed photos. Maybe I'm shining a light with my other hand, or hanging from something. Using the volume button often means covering the screen with my hand (and thus not framing it well), and also slightly moves the phone when I actually press the button, meaning I might lose focus or just not frame it well.  When the app is open, I think there should be an *""enable voice control""* that uses the same voice recognition as Siri. When enabled, all the user would have to do is audibly say the command - perhaps ""click"" - and it would snap the photo. No more compromising the shot or risking the safety of the phone by holding it in precarious ways.  That's all. Food for thought; I didn't want this idea to die without being heard.",apple

Does sales tax apply to Apple Care, and is the cost for Apple Care dependent on the configuration you get or total sales price of the laptop? 3. Is there any benefit to purchasing Apple Care from Costco instead of elsewhere?",apple

"iphone 11 esim questions! Hello guys, recently i bought an esim for my friends iphone 11, but the i have a few questions regarding dual sim iphone11.   personally i use a samsung s9 and there is a feature that allows you to choose which sim is for data/calls/internet  etc etc,  there's also the option to disable 2nd sim and re-activate whenever you want. (which hides the double signal bars at the top of the screen and the option to choose what sim to call from)   basically my question is, are the same features available on the iphone 11?  please note that i used dual physical sims on my samsung while she already has a physical sim on her iphone and is planning on activating the e-sim   &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: She doesn't want anyone to notice she has dual sims is there anyway to go around that?",apple
"Who thinks we need customizable folders or atleast a rearrangement option for all our Apple movies/tv shows?  I, like many of you have a decent growing library of digital movies/shows purchased through iTunes, some with franchises that are 10+movies deep (marvel, Star Wars, DC, etc). When it comes to having a large movie collection digitally, I think we should be able to arrange them (besides purchase date or alphabetical) any way we want. When it comes to a physical collection, we can arrange them by franchise, then chronological, or by our favorite directors or personal favorite genres (mind bending, futuristic, historical, etc). Hopefully Apple can implement something like this in a future update.",apple

"iCloud Photos - let‚Äôs discuss I‚Äôm an iPhone user since day one and had never iCloud photos enabled. Mostly because I had private photos on my phone, my backup was made locally every now and then. I had also in the past always the biggest possible storage on the phone. And I NEVER reached the limit.  That said I wanted to try it out since I like the new photos feature and how you can experience your pictures in a nicer way and in order to use it properly I kept my recent photos instead of backin up and eventually deleting them.   So now my question: what happens if you have one day so many photos that the iCloud is not enough anymore? Can you buy always more and more? On my local backup I have enough TB so this will be enough for a lifetime. And so you make an ‚Äúadditional‚Äù local backup? And yes I know that iCloud photos is not an backup, just access.  And an additional thought to that, do you want to stay dependent on iCloud photos?  My two cents: for now it‚Äôs nice to have pictures from my last year easy accessible.

The accommodation consists of 10 people + us 2 , and for the past 2 months from what I've seen they look like decent humans, no one seems sketchy but you never know. I understand its completely our fault and its pure irresponsibility . Have you got an idea of what should we do , the MacBook didn't dissolve into the air so someone took it. Do I/her knock on their doors and politely ask them if they have seen it or anything else you have in mind or if you have been in similar situations . Peace",apple
"Apple Airpods Pro ANC continuously learning to filter out sounds? Hello there!  I just got my new AirPods Pro and I was wondering about its ANC function. I was going to work by train a there were two women sitting next to my the entire ride. I switched on the ANC which somewhat muted their voices, but I could still hear them pretty clearly. But travelling for 50 minutes, when my train was arriving at the final station, I noticed that I can barely hear them anymore.  I'm not sure whether I was just imagining things, but I had a feeling that the ANC somehow got familiar with their voices and learned to filter it out even more. Did you have a similar experience? Or it was just a coincidence? Can the ANC get better over time, like machine learning or something?",apple

I also recently updated my iphone SE to an 11 pro but honestly i only really use it for web browsing/ looking at reddit, music and youtube.   &amp;#x200B;  Honestly feel like I'm wasting the potential of the tech I have on my hands, is there anything else I could be doing with my phone/tablet? I don't really have much interest in mobile gaming.  &amp;#x200B;  I've never really much of an interest in digital art but maybe it's a good avenue to start with?  &amp;#x200B;  Any recommendations would be really appreciated!  Thanks in advance",apple
"Unable to share screen on google meet (Chrome) after updating to Catalina even after allowing permission. Any idea? Hi guys  So, at work i often use google meet to present something or for meeting generally. I updated my macOS to Catalina a few days ago and apparently i can't share my screen anymore bcs of the permission even tho i already checked and allowed it for Chrome.   Worst thing, this happened when i was about to present something important to a huge crowd, i ended up hv to use other people's windows laptop to present it which is a bad experience and fucked up my whole presentation, bcs everything i prepared for the presentation is on my mac.

"The fact that Apple locks your entire PAID iTunes collection ($7,000+) if they can‚Äôt process a payment ($2.99) is absolutely absurd. We use a separate account to pay random BS, and we noticed that Apple tried to charge $2.99 for a purchased episode of a show we purchased that wasn‚Äôt able to process due to us not transferring over the money for the week.   Before transferring money over to the account to get it covered, we realized that Apple will put an entire freeze on your PAID content until the payment goes through.   We‚Äôve spent close to, if not we‚Äôll over, $7,000 on movies in our collection and TV shows through the years. Movies and TV shows that we OWN and have been PAID FOR.   This is just a PSA to anyone who doesn‚Äôt know this. What an absurd policy to hold hostage items that have been paid for because of $2.99 (or any figure for that matter).   How is this allowed?

One feature of the Airpods Pro that is overlooked imo The new controls.  They are so much better to me. On the original Airpods it was a hit or miss if u touched the right part of the airpod. Because of the flat surface on the airpods pro you know where to squeeze and it works way better imo.,apple
"I like Apple TV+ but I wish Apple does couple of improvements to the media player I have been watching Apple TV+ for a day now and I like the content. Production value is great, scenarios are cool. Discovering shows is also so much nicer than Netflix or Youtube. However, the media player is not user friendly in comparison to Youtube or Netflix.  Firstly, I think it would be nicer to double tap to skip forward/backward 15 seconds. Secondly, as in Netflix, I think it would be very useful to mark a show as complete when credits come out; also, skip recap/intro of the show.",apple

I know they have made some progress with that language in recent years so I'm wondering if it has reach a point where Apple is starting to rewrite a lot of software for all the different OS's, and possibly parts of the OS's themselves in Swift and maybe that's a cause of some of these recent bugs.

"Worried about the AirPods Pro not fitting because of the rubber tips? I was too Just wanted to share, not everyone is able to reach an Apple store and try out a pair before purchasing.  When Apple first announced the AirPods Pro, I was skeptical about purchasing them because my ears have never worked with the rubber tip style. Upon trying a demo pair I realized the rubber tips do little to nothing for actually keeping them in your ear. Instead it‚Äôs the plastic of the Pods that fit into the ear, and the rubber tips are basically solely for sealing them air tight. Definitely satisfied with how my new pair fit and sound!  If you‚Äôre worried they won‚Äôt fit based on past experiences with the rubber style, you‚Äôll find they should fit just fine.",apple

"PSA: Do NOT Use Live Listen w/ Beats Solo Pro I just got my Powerbeats Pro two hours ago and I LOVE them so far. However, I came across a major issue that I suspect is software related.

I‚Äôve only tested this feature out with the Powerbeats Pro, so I was interested to see how this feature would work with headphones.

It was so loud and shocking that I yanked the headphones off my head with one hand in a split instant.   I am in contact with Apple Support as I‚Äôm typing this.

AirPods Pro and the U1 UWB chip Does anyone else find it odd that Apple left out the U1 ultra wideband chip from the new AirPods Pro or the AirPods Pro case?  An UWB chip is capable of providing very accurate location of devices. Apple added the UWB chip to all iPhone 11's. If the rumored AirTags are true (Apple acquired the trademark and references are in the beta iOS releases) then its likely the U1 chip will play a role in its Tag tracking &amp; leave-behind notifications.  Accurately tracking a device is a perfect use case for AirPods with a U1 chip as people complain about losing them or leaving them behind. When improved device tracking releases this year with an AirTag using UWB chip it will seem like a miss that Apple didn't add a UWB U1 to the AirPods Pro. Unfortunately a teardown by iFixIt doesn't show a U1 chip in the latest product.,apple

This way, old stereo system would become smart, which would be good for the environment apple is boasting to care about, and you‚Äòd have an incentive to get into the smart home game.   Why did they discontinue this great thing?",apple
"Is there something wrong with my AirPods Pro? I just picked up  the Air Pods Pro, and i expected a solid upgrade from my regular first gen airPods.   I got fairly dissapointed tho for a number of reasons. But reading reviews i feel something is not right.   The problems i have encountered after 2-3 hours of usage:  \-The sound is not really as good as the previous airPods, especially feels lacking in the deep frequencies (bass)  \-The sound is suffering from compression artifacts, escpecially in high frequencies like whitenoise in edm music, or percussion in other genres. (Low bitrate over bluetooth? Not having this problem with other BT headphones)  \-Desync between the pods, one hanging behind the other in the playback ( delay ).  \-Random noise in one pod, making me having to put them in the charger (to reboot them)  \-Toggling between noise cancellation and passtrough not working, again having to put them in the charger to reboot them  &amp;#x200B;  But yeah, most of all, the audio quality is lacking. I have even done the diagnostic to check if the airseal from the cups is good. I feel like the audio on the first gen airPods are alot better",apple
"Can't Find Airpods! Not on Find My iPhone! Hi all,  I've had my Airpods since May 2019 (this year). The last time I've used them was Thursday, October 24. One full week ago. And I used them on the train ride and drive home. I had a very busy weekend and was driving to and from work throughout the week, so I did not use them. I don't use them at work. So, the idea of someone stealing them is weird since I last had them when I got home on Friday. La**st I checked, they were on Find My iPhone. I have even used the feature a couple of times. Today, however, I don't see them on Find My iPhone.** Like, it's not listed anymore  What is the possibility someone either went into my bag, stole them and connected it to their iCloud while disabling mine?

"Relics of Old Apple Design in Mojave For those of you who aren't aware of what skeuomorphism is, it's a design style that tries to imitate real-life objects. Think the old notepad app that looked like real paper, etc. Apple was famous for it until they completely killed it off with iOS 7, six years ago, in favor of the newer aesthetic that we currently all have on our phones and desktops.  Except, they didn't kill it completely.

"Does AirPods Pro sound quality get better over time? So I got my Airpod Pros this morning and my initial impression was meh. They sounded almost the same as the second gen airpods I have, maybe a tiny bit better. After a few hours of listening, I feel like these sound much better than this morning. The instrument separation seems to be so much better compared to second gens, and overall reproduction of the music feels so much more lively. It is really apparent while listening to the mid and highs back to back with airpod 2s.

"I like the AirPods Pro but super worried about the battery If you didn't know lithium batteries develop more internal stress at very low or very high voltages, but you want it to go from very high to very low to get the maximum capacity out of them. In reality, applications where you absolutely need every last mAh of capacity like phones, the maximum charge level is higher than say, in a Tesla, or even a MacBook. Also the faster you drain or charge the battery, the faster it dies, this is related to time, so if you drain it in 10 hours versus 4 hours, it will last longer, same with charging  Since it's a pair of headphones, it tends to not go out of date for a long time, so while I like the portability of the EarPods Pro, I'm worried the battery won't be very durable and maybe I'll be better off with the Beats Solo Pro, since it's got a much bigger battery and so it will last much longer.",apple

So I ask, for music/stereo folks, what setup do you use? I'm leaning towards a few Sonos 1's, and a Sonos 5, since it has an input that I could use with my record player.",apple

Can we take a minute to appreciate how amazing Apple's Offline Finding is for AirTags?

"Catalina AirPlay 2 Support within the OS Hello,  I know it is supposed to have it, but does anyone know if Apple has plans to support AirPlay 2 from Catalina?  I understand iTunes supports it, but it doesn't appear Catalina supports it.  If I set my audio output within settings to an AirPlay audio device, I can only pick 1 AirPlay device at a time.  Additionally the audio sync is like a second or two behind which was normal for AirPlay 1 where as AirPlay 2 destinations are always in sync with the source like when I output my AppleTV to an AirPlay destination.  I know 10.14.5 announced support for AirPlay 2, but it doesn't seem like it's support is within the OS.  Maybe only within iTunes.  Anyone observe this or have a different thought about this?",apple

"Let‚Äôs talk iMac... As our mobile devices (iPhones and iPads) become stronger and more versatile, the need for my MacBook Pro has faded. What I used to need mobile use of it for, I now do from my phone. So that leads me to potentially switching it out for an iMac instead.   Having been blissfully unaware of the iMac environment as a desktop never made sense - are there certain models never to touch (a la certain MBPs that are awful)? Are there specific models or features to pay up for or avoid?  My initial thoughts are picking up a used quad core i5 21.5‚Äù late 2015 model with the 4K screen for around $600. Concerned about the lack of fusion drives and availability of anything other than a 5400rpm 1TB drive. For my limited use, size &gt; performance, but due to the inability to replace things, I don‚Äôt want the HDD to always be a hampering point.   This will not be a powerhouse machine use case.

Why did Samsung place the bottom speaker grill on the left side of the Note 20 Ultra? I have the Note 10+ so I don't have to worry about it but I would think that having that speaker on the left side is where your pinky rests when holding it in the vertical position so you would be covering the speaker itself and would even be covering it as well when holding it in landscape with your right hand.

Is the Note line discontinued? I really have enjoyed my Note 10+ and think it is unfortunate if this is the case.

How Samsung made me a millionaire A friend of mine was working in a cellphone store. To do him a favor and boost his performance ratings I bought a phone. At the time I already had the latest iphone so I bought an android phone (Samsung Galaxy).   Android has so many Crypto apps that iPhone app store does not. I  wasI bored one night and was surfing through the play store when I came across one app that basically suggested I should hold 1 millionth of the supply of Bitcoin.  So I gradually bought 21 Bitcoin and kept buying. Bitcoin has since risen dramatically and the 50 Bitcoin I own are now worth more than 1.5 million Thanks Samsung.,samsung

I'd like a 5g s9, more battery,  take the extra camera money and build a new tower closer to me.    Anyone else feel that way.",samsung

"Samsung Galaxy s21 ultra Bluetooth problems Hi let's start a little discussion here,  So on my old s21 base model I never had any Bluetooth issues. But on the ultra, I have noticed high pitched squeaking at times in my earbuds. Doing some research I have read that this happens because of android wear and diverting Bluetooth power and stuff. But, I have another issue that doesnt seem to be fixed. Every single time I use my Bluetooth earbuds to talk on the phone it gets disconnected randomly. This does not happen when I am just using the earbuds to talk. I have Android wear disabled and unpaired and restarted my phone. So it can't be that.  Anyways, any other ultra users having this disconnecting problem?",samsung

"A-series always. If you have ideas of not touching the S or Note or Fan series phones that Samsung offers, it's imho and from whatever I've seen, heard and read would be in your best interest to go for A series phones. The A5x and A7x line-up of phones are receiving 3 next OS upgrades and 4 years of security patches. The M and F series might be good value in the hardware department but receive one year less. Also the hardware doesn't seem as worse for value-for-money than the M series this year. Plus since the A series is international I expect fewer software compromises and better support.  # P.S. correct me if I'm wrong.",samsung

"Lack of security updates unlocked note8 Hi all, I understand Samsung Note8 has graduated to quarterly updates last year. Carrier builds like Tmobile have done a good job in updating their branded builds with timely updates. However the Unlocked variants are stuck at Oct 2000 security.   Who is responsible for the updates? Samsung or the carrier (in my case I use Unlocked note8 with Tmobile)... Once I heard it's a cat and mouse chase.. Samsung claiming the carriers call the shots vs carriers saying otherwise.   Is there anyway to escalate this? Running a phone with less than optimal security updates is bad for business users.
