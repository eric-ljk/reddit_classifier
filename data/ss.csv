Gold_Enigma,1635289011,"I bought a pair of galaxy buds+ a little under a year ago in the US and thought they worked very well with apple’s galaxy bud app (yes I have an iPhone). I loved them and they were very sturdy throughout that year and during that year I moved to Canada. yesterday the left earbud stopped working for no reason and as I still had a month of warranty left I just assumed that I would be able to send them in for warranty. NOPE I would have to send them for warranty in the US and because my address was now in Canada the warranty was no longer valid.   Ok end of story right? Nope. after deliberating with my self on whether to buy the buds pro or AirPods Pro I settled on the buds pro because they were on sale at my local bestbuy. So I get them from bestbuy and try them on only to find out the galaxy bud app doesn’t support the buds pro. YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THESE HAVE BEEN OUT FOR 10 MONTHS AND THEYRE STILL NOT SUPPORTED. Probably can’t return them now that I’ve worn them but if I can, I’m fully switching to apple.  TLDR: buds+ stopped working, warranty invalid because I moved, bought new buds pro, not supported by galaxy buds app",samsung,Samsung is really pissing me off today?

Jorycle,1635285986,"Rant mode.  So we bought some appliances like 6 months back. It took them so long to come in stock thanks to supply shortages that they didn't ship until last week.  Well, life's changed in the millennia between purchase and ship. I've switched jobs, got a few haircuts, and oh yeah, we bought a house. So we needed this refrigerator to be shipped to the new address a couple miles away from the old one.  Turns out Samsung has a policy that you *can't change delivery addresses*. Only cancel the order and make a whole new one. That's right, even though this thing was just down the street from our house at this point, Samsung insists they'd have to cancel the order and make us wait months for a new one to come in stock, then ship that one across the country again - rather than say, you know, just slapping a new  address on that bad boy. Makes total sense.  We're technically in this house a few more days, and we kind of need the appliances, so fine, we agreed to accept the appliances here. Sure, we'll have to pay movers to get them to the new house, but you know, whatever.  One of the appliances comes out looking like it got beat with a hammer. Dented and scratches to hell, and one of the doors had a broken hinge, but it still mostly worked - so Samsung tells me I can keep it so I have an appliance until their replacement arrives.  (Sidenote, the offer of replacement followed a comical telephone auction: ""we'll offer you compensation instead of replacement. No? Repair 1 problem and compensation? Repair 2 problems and less compensation? Repair 3 problems and no compensation? Fine, replacement!"")  It turns out the replacement can only be sent to the same address. Same policy.  Now, we *definitely* will not be living at this address when this replacement arrives. Samsung tells me it is impossible to change this address. The technology simply does not exist to change a line on a shipping order, and so they have - apparently without a drop of sarcasm - told me that I can *buy a whole new appliance* and then ask them to refund the old one after it arrives. Or simply never get my broken appliance replaced. They tell me these are my only two options.  TL;DR: it's the year of our lord 2021 and mankind still doesn't have the technology to change a shipping address.  Anyone else had a chance to enjoy some of Samsung's more brilliant policies?",samsung,"Samsung delivery policies: Stupid, or the stupidest?"

Shadeslayur,1635281486,"I've had a S21 Ultra since launch. I've tried a number of screen protectors for this device, notably the film-based ones, a plastic one, and a glass one.

The plastic ones get scratched by literally anything in my pockets and the edges begin to come up within a week or two.

The finish on the glass feels amazing and the fingerprint sensor works perfectly. It comes with extra pieces if you mess up and a limited warranty plus 20% off future purchases from them. It fits with cases with no issues that other screen protectors have had.   I've also noticed that its anti-fingeprint and oil coating is superb.

OldFatMantx,1635271511,"I am the ultimate Samnsung Fanboy. I got Galaxy Tab 7FE, Tab 6, Tab S7 lite, Note 10+ and Z fold 3, not to mention a fridge and TV.  I didn't go a lot of digging on the Z Fold 3, I knew it was an upgrade to Z fold 2 and I wanted it. The lack of charger, the 2 foot charging cable, the lack of microSD (all the items I mentioned above all have expandable storage and even the cheap free Tab S7 lite I got free came with a charger and expandable memory!).   What pissed me off even further was I tried to use the Spen from Tab6 then Tab7 on the Zfold only to find out you get a message saying you need the official pen for it to work and a link to their site.   I got a hold of Samsung customer service. I explained what got me angry and disappointed about their ""new flagship device"" and for these reasons I switched from Apple who was trying to milk every penny out of their customers. Even a few of my past cheap phones came with chargers and expandable memory. I was asked to be placed on hold to speak with a service representative in escalations. Again I expressed my concerns and said, ""I will never buy another Samsung product unless charging bricks and expandable memory make a comeback.""  I was offered 50% off of a Samsung Galaxy 4 watch and said, ""No thank you, I do not want any other Samsung devices."" I was then offered 1TB of cloud storage for free. I asked, ""For life?"" They replied, ""No for one full year."" Then I chuckled, so Samsung can get more of my money in the future when I need to keep that data, no thank you.""  This led me to another escalation department, forgot what they called themselves, but they was higher than last two I talked to. I was asked if I would like a free fast charging brick and I said yes, AND I want a longer wire. I was asked if I purchased a fast charging brick or fast wireless charger and I said yes, but from Anker just so Samsung doesn't get my money. She chuckled. I got some sort of promo code for 50% off a galaxy 4 watch, and 50% off something else I'd never buy. When they asked if there was anything they could do for me, I said YES! Get me a Galaxy Tag + for free. You're not getting my loyalty back. I just want to see if Samsung gives a shit about me. Turns out they did.   So, I am encouraging you to call in and give a complaint about the lack of charging brick and how every other Samsung device has expandable memory except for this one. Don't be rude or demanding. Just explain how loyal you've been and considering how much money you've spend on their latest and greatest how it would be nice to get a charging brick and expandable memory.   If we don't speak up.

DAM091,1635127494,"I remember on one of my old phones, might have been the S3 or S5, they had 2 pretty cool and useful features. One was being able to answer, ignore or end a call, and do a variety of other things, without touching the screen; you could just hover a finger over the button. The other was auto pausing a video if you weren't looking at it. It would track your eyes to pause while you looked away.   I remember both these features being shown on the commercial for the phone. A guy was cooking and following a YouTube video. Every time he looked at the phone, it would play and show him the next step; then he'd turn towards the food and the video would pause. Somebody called him and his hands were dirty, so he answers by hovering his finger over the button. I found both features very useful. I can't imagine they would be expensive to implement, though admittedly I'm just guessing.  Why does Samsung abandon features like these? What other useful features that you liked have disappeared?",samsung,Why does Samsung abandon useful features?

kennym30,1635119877,"This may be obvious to some, but it wasn't for me and I want to share my experience. I wanted to get a new phone to replace my destroyed S9 plus in hopes that I would enjoy the 120hz display and new features. I did, but I realized that the physical feel was simply worse.   It feels more hollow than the S9 and FEELS slower, as if there is a very small but noticeable amount of latency that keeps the phone from feeling premium. It also sometimes lags and it really shows on the 120hz display, as if it can't keep up.   One big one is the headphone jack. I know people have moved on, but I always find bluetooth to be an inconvenience. My bluetooth buds always seem to be out of battery when I need them and I refuse to buy usb to 3.5mm adapters.   Another one is the NFC. I didn't think this would be a problem, but it is. I listen to music in the shower, and every day I pair my phone by tapping it on my Sony SRSX3. Just tap and boom it turns on automatically and pairs. That was with my S9 plus. On the S20FE the NFC area is much smaller and weaker so I have to contact my phone with the speaker and slide it around until it pairs. It's annoying.  One big pro that is keeping me from selling my S20FE is the camera. The camera system is amazing, a huge upgrade from the S9 and I'm having a hard time departing from this phone as a result.",samsung,S20FE is a downgrade from the S9 Plus

No-Zookeepergame-301,1634836199,"I'm a long time nexus/pixel user who has not had a Samsung phone since the S4. I picked up the S21 Ultra in February so I could get 5G on T-Mobile. Phone was great until the screen broke after a very mild drop and had dead pixels. Multiple issues finding a uBreakiFix place that could actually do the repair and had the screaming stopped and wasted probably six hours of time I had to take off of work to get it done.  After it was repaired I started noticing issues with audio. When on speaker sometimes one speaker with turn off and only the other speaker would play. I would also get very tinny high pitched sounding noise. UBreakiFix ran a diagnostic and figured out it was the motherboard and I had to send it back to Samsung to repair  I called Samsung last week and said everything off and was told three to five business days after they receive the phone it'll be sent back. They received the phone on Monday, didn't process it until Tuesday, and now say that it's going to be up to 10 business days between running a 48-hour diagnostic, repair, 48 hour out going Diagnostic, and then ship back. That's almost two weeks without the phone  I have an Enterprise exchange account that I cannot get to work on a backup phone so I'm now without my work access for 2 weeks. This is the biggest issue. I can go without having the luxuries of a smartphone but not having 24/7 push access to my email at work account is a big problem.  Compared to apple where you can walk into a store and walk out with either a repaired or refurbished phone or Google where they just shipped you a refurbished phone and then you send your phone back.  They don't even offer the option of sending me a refurbished phone and they can keep mine to refurbish it and resell  Needless to say, despite the fact that I love this phone, I will never purchase another Samsung again. I had a pixel XL 3 and was waiting for the 5 but was underwhelmed with the offering and did not upgrade to it. When this phone is paid off, I am going to go back to Google.

I took the case off yesterday to see how much dust and junk was accumulating underneath and in the corners as I typically do a month or so into a new phone/case combo. Well after doing so I started looking around the phone and on the EXTERIOR portion here:   I noticed that where the left edge of the case met the phone, which is RIGHT on the end of the bezel but still slightly touching the screen? It's been making TONS of micro scratches. At first I was like ""Nooo noo, maybe it's just scuffed it"". But freak, no these are all DEEP enough that running my fingernail across them I can feel each and every one of them.   I guess in designing something that could fit on a notoriously harder than normal to design for Phone they've put the left side of the exterior portion way too far into the screen, so with regular use the VERY thin left side moves in and out over time just a littttttle bit, enough to make these scratches. It sucks that's for sure; I took the case off and that's that. No more using the VRS Design Hard Drop.   Just wanted to let folks know, I wouldn't recommend using this on a virgin phone; if you have a screen protector on the EXTERIOR screen? Maybe that could mitigate it. But damn I'm disappointed. Luckily I noticed it early enough that the scratches still aren't TOO noticeable, from regular viewing/using distance they're invisible, and because it's on the FAR left side of the screen, 90% of them are on the BLACK bezel portion of the screen that doesn't have any pixels, so it doesn't affect the viewing portion almost at all. But Damn... still I'm disappointed in making even hard to notice micro scratches in my brand new EXPENSIVE AF phone lol. Oh well, live and learn. But now I""m on the hunt again for a new case.   I forgot how amazing this phone feels without a case.. it's like sex without a .. you know.

I have noticed that unlike last month where the number of companies even MAKING a case for this phone was super low, this time around they have suddenly exploded in options. Which hey, more competition and options are a good thing. But now that I'm aware of the potential for screen scratches in a case designed even HAFLWAY similar to the VRS one?

GuntherBkk,1634427679,"As a PC gamer I always keep an eye out for the latest tech and well, for those looking for a new screen the Odyssey Neo G9 did not go unnoticed. Seeing all that juicy tech packed in that display is both a blessing as a curse and that is the main reason I decided to post this as I really for the life of me can't figure out Samsung and some of their questionable choices.     The odyssey Neo G9 shows the possibilities AND the massive improvements that can be made by using mini-led, FALD, an increased amount of dimming zones, etc. It is great to see that and yet again it isn't because there simply is no other alternative to a design and screen that is excessive in more than just one way. Its design, though looking great, is also assuming every gamer has a game room with a massive desk or a corner to put the screen into. Granted, the curve helps in terms of how easy it is to view the content on the screen but it also results in more required desk space. And let us be fair, the 49"" super ultrawide is massive. It requires 115 cm (45.3 inches) of your desk / space which is just massive. It is even more wide then their 50"" QN90A !!!   So what do we, the more common type of gamer, do? We search for possible alternatives and then we are not getting really excited as there simply is no news of any upcoming ultrawide around the 34"" to 38"" of sizing.    The next thing that happens is that you start looking at other types of screens and then TV's come to mind. And oh my, there will be a 43"" QN90A !!! You start reading up on how TV's are for PC gaming, you'll even go have a look at the shops, do some tests on several screens in the QN90A series and you realize these screens are awesome for various reasons. Knowing that that 43"" could fit the bill and the desk is actually exciting...until it is not that exciting anymore.      It starts with some small post on one of the outreaches on the internet where they claim the 43"" model will just be a 60Hz screen. Haha, ok, good one, this TV is being released in the QN90A series so I have to assume someone made a dumb mistake as it really does not make any sense a TV in the same series as it siblings would be having different specs. Haha, god one, you almost got me there!?    But then, more details pop up and Rtings mentions the same 60Hz and then some...no VRR, no adaptive sync compatibility? What the F...?    Is it just me when I say that absolutely does not make no sense at all. Why is it even being released in the QN90A series? Apart from the mini-led it does not share anything related to that series.    I do not see the point of that screen / TV as it is inferior to any other model in the same series which renders it pointless in my opinion.      Also, the QN90A series are actually getting the attention of PC gamers so building on that attention would have been key. Instead this rather feels like the middle finger being thrown to our faces. Is Samsung worried it would be making a direct competitor with that 43"" to their own Odyssey Neo G9? Well, it quite possibly could have become that but aren't they realizing that G9 is just going to be for a niche market anyway? Look at the popularity of OLED TV. These TV's are selling way better than the Neo G9 will ever do (as computer screens) and expecting anything different is just living in a dream world. No Samsung, I advice you all to take your heads out of the clouds and get back in touch with the full gaming community. I think a horrible mistake was made and you'll going to realize it in a couple of months when a direct competitor will release their 42"" OLED which won't be a stripped-down version of their 48"" model.",samsung,PC Gaming and displays: Is Samsung living on a cloud?

mercenary_58,1634424852,"hey, first off I live in UK and I'm looking to switch to samsung from my iPhone 7. so currently on my iPhone 7 and have been tackling issues like phone completely freezing for a solid minute or 2 before lagging as hell for a second then returning back to normal, phone screen going black while phone seems to be on and the storage is pretty low (I have 32gb so not enough)  anyways, I have been thinking of going to Samsung for that ability to choose and customise to my liking and the feel of hardware (I don't know why but when holding a Samsung phone like s9 (uncles phone) it feels so comfortable, plus I'm kinda sick of being on a simple set up where my only android like option is jailbreak but that comes with its own issues.   so now I'm in the market of a new Samsung phone and have been thinking between base S20, 4g S20 FE or base S21. I don't really like the A series because of the thought that I had a flagship iPhone and now have moved to a budget phone. and I don't like the Note series because of the coneer radius which looks sharp more than curved (which I love) on teh S series. I've heard here in UK we get exynos over Snapdragon so not sure what to think about performance and battery for that. my biggest importance are performace, speed, battery, device longetivity. camera is something I don't usually do and I'm satisfied with what I can take on my iPhone 7.  Now, my dad (has a10s) recengly said that money is tight currently so I am going to have to choose something cheap and because I like the S series, he proposed I get a second hand S10 which can be bought for £170 - £200. I dont have much problem with that but I'm not really wanting to get another second hand phone. I've never actually experienced a brand new phone from box because I have usually been given a phone from relatives who don't use them or from Facebook marketplace (iphone 4 then 5s then 7 all second handed).   that said I really wanted a new phone and have said that I'll try to manage until money isnt a problem. but now I am worried my phone won't last since it's issues are increasing every day. I thought maybe by the time money isnt a problem (by mid 2022 money should be fine as my dad said) my choices of phone could get cheaper so I could get an S20 or s20 FE or S21 brand new.  what do u think I should do? and what phone to get?  sorry for this extremely long post, I just wanted to get my thoughts out rather than leaving them to my self",samsung,planning on switching from an iPhone 7 to a samsung

hongdawg,1634322756,"Hello folks. I just wanted to share my recent experience with Samsung repair process. I've been with Samsung since I left iPhone 3GS (Yes been awhile..) and this was the first time dealing with their repair service.  I had purchased a Galaxy Book Pro 360 in July. Ever since then I had a weird issue with the laptop whenever I plugged and unplugged the power charger where the screen would flicker. I thought nothing of it since it didn't bother me.  About a week ago or so when I opened the laptop I noticed this huge green dot on the left side of the screen with a vertical blackline over it. I first contacted a Samsung care representative over the online chat and during the process he asked me for serial numbers and I gave him the one that's on the original box the laptop came with. However, apparently that is not the whole number and there was one letter/number missing at the end. He told me to look underneath the laptop to find it and I just couldn't find it. (Later I found out that there is indeed S/N at the bottom but it was so small I couldn't see it..) But anyway, he proceeded to ask me to call the number he provided. I called the number and was able to get in touch directly with another Samsung care representative. She was able to pull out a full S/N on her side and process the repair. I took a picture of the screen with an issue and texted her. She explained all the necessary steps I had to take to get the laptop over to the repair shop which was local.  One of the steps was to reset the laptop to the factory setting before shipping it to be repaired. I proceeded to reset the laptop but during the process there was an error while installing the windows and I could not get it to the desktop for some reason. Well, I decided to just ship the laptop as it is hoping that the technician would fix the issue for me.  The laptop then was shipped and arrived at the shop within 2 days. They worked on it the following day and was shipped that very day and I received the repaired laptop the next day. I was pleasantly surprised how fast and efficient this whole process was! They not only replaced the OLED screen but reset the windows as well.  In the end I am a very satisfied customer and thumbs up to the Samsung care team and the repair shop.",samsung,A pleasant repair service experience with Samsung

SwimBikeRunLA,1634229382,"I switched from the S10e to the Z Flip 3 about a week ago. I loved my S10e but the battery was getting pretty bad, and had 4 old unused devices I could trade in while keeping my S10e as backup.  Overall I like the Z Flip 3, it's technically very impressive:  \+ Having a larger screen that folds into a small size is amazing. As someone who prefers compact phones, it's great to have a larger screen for once. The screen itself is amazing, and I don't mind the crease where the hinge is.  \+ Overall design and build quality is top notch: surprisingly heavier than the S10e which feels premium.  \+ OS and performance is snappy, though to be fair my S10e was also fast. I would say the Z Flip 3 is roughly 10-20% quicker in general.  \+ Battery is surprisingly good despite everything I've read. The first couple days was bad, but after putting some unused apps in deep sleep and the phone adjusting to my usage I'm at about 5 hours of SoT which is enough to get me through the day.  But here are some concerns that have me consider returning it:  \- Camera: I was expecting it to be on par with my S10e, but sometimes the photos come out really blurry or the color balance is way off. Maybe this can be improved with software.  \- Lack of SD card and headphone jack is annoying. Understand not everyone needs these, but for me they're useful. Hate that Samsung is joining this industry trend for flagships, but inexplicably keeping them on their lower models (i.e Galaxy A52 5G).  \- Durability: even though the phone is well built, I'm very careful as the screen protector feels soft, and the hinge and lack of dust resistance are less durable than traditional phones. Yesterday I dropped the phone in dirt at the park playing with the kids. Rinsing off the dirt was easy, but I now notice a very faint scraping sound as the hinge opens/closes (as though some dust got into the hinge). Doesn't impact operation, but the larger concern is if dust/grime builds up over time.  For those that have had the phone for longer, does anyone else have some similar concerns especially related to durability? Thanks!",samsung,Should I keep my Z Flip 3?

I just wanted to see what they would say, and of course the IT Tech claims that there are no other ways or alternative methods to do it. Imagine I am someone older and less tech savy, I would have just lost all hope and proceeded to have to throw away all my journals and task lists etc. that are an essential part of my life because Samsung couldn't be bothered to help, let alone tell the truth.

thecofffeeguy,1633726573,"   TL;DR Apple fanboys dont know what they are missing till they can see it with their eyes.  I went into best buy today to look at the new iPad mini and maybe pick one up. I asked about iOS 15 (iPhone) to see if they gained any new features. We bantered around a bit and they said they could convince me to switch to an iPhone 13 with the new OS+Hardware. (ITS ON NOW BOIZ)  1. I asked about split screen multitasking and a genuine clipboard. Obviously iOS can do neither of these things and the 2 Apple attendants acted like it was not a necessary feature. But then I took out my note10 and showed them split screen and their jaws dropped. One asked how long I have been able to do that, I said since 2015 with the note4. 2. Next I showed them the clipboard built into the keyboard, how I could grab something I copied from 5 days ago and paste it into a text or webpage... I may have broken one of their loyalties to Apple.  That is the readers digest of it all, I showed them a few other things that iPhones cannot do and 80% of the things I showed them, they didn't know we could do.  The Kool-aide drinkers think Android is a unstable buggy mess. But when they see it in action without rose colored glasses. When they see how lacking iOS is as a mobile work station. When they see the features we have, how snappy and easy it is to do the simple tasks, they have a hard time telling us to our faces how ""ApPLEe is SO fAr aHEad"". I was thinking about getting an iPhone just to have a nice flat display, but I will look around for an android alternative.

Anyway, sending large videos by emails is impossible. I am also very frustrated by the Private Share application by Samsung which is limite to only some devices.  So recently, I have recently developed a mobile application to let users share photos and videos securely while preserving their privacy.    Poltreder allows you to share your photos and videos without storing them in any cloud server to preserve your privacy. Sharing is secure and end-to-end encrypted between mobile terminals, and photos or videos are transferred directly from device to device (P2P) without any intermediate server. Only your friends have a copy of your photos and videos, but they cannot access them to save elsewhere (screenshot is also disabled). It's time now to regain control of your content! Your data privacy is the main concern of the Poltreder application. Imagine Poltreder as the Signal of Instagram!  I just released the application one week ago. So this is a very new application.  You can install Poltreder from Google Play:     Please feel free to comment or ask for any support. Bug reports are also helpful for me to improve the application.   Please for considering my post.

I'm not integrated into the Apple ecosystem entirely, loved my Airpods, lost them of course so nothing ties me back to it.

In this case its i haven't done anything wrong link dropped a phone or got it wet, its clearcut manufacturing defect. No doubt they are going to replace motherboard but it will remove fit and finish if product, increase gap and by time more problems will come..

The note 4 also had great photos, just an older sensor, but colors were SPOT ON. Starting with my s9, Samsung slowly started their saturation creep. The S20 series and S21 series pictures are just way too saturated. I don't know who in the marketing department did tests, but the pictures are too unrealistic to color in real life. We don't need overly greens, super blue skies and bright reds. The whole image in general is just too saturated. Comparing pics side by side taken with the S8, the S8 has much better pictures. The sensor is so much better on the S21, but ruined by post processing. A tad too much noise reduction making images muddy, and again, the over saturation. We shouldn't have to post process every picture.  I never had an iPhone and never want one, but their camera is light years ahead. I absolutely love how their images look, and they are LIFELIKE.

ultraviolet4752,1633524605,"I have been looking forward to buy something nice this year because my J7 prime is 5 year old at this point. But looking at the state of M,F and even A series makes me worry. M series will either have a big notch or One UI Core or both. F series has outdated processor and the best one doesn't have 60 fps video recording on any resolution. A series is just so overpriced as compared to its competitors. Even with compensating for Samsung Knox. Strange pattern of missing features which seem almost intentional. We didn't even get A52 5G. Also the 4G variant is always out of stock. A52s 5G is so far in the price range that at that point people would just buy some other close to flagship phone or S20FE 5G considering its on a heavy discount.  What I feel is that Samsung pushing it's customers to Rs 30000 (400 USD) price range. And low priced models are not only underpowered but just very bad in terms of build quality and features. The only think which is stopping people from switching to other brands is One UI. Samsung Knox would also be one distinguishing feature but most M series just don't have that or just the software version is implemented.  I would buy Xiaomi, but the software experience is terrible. Sure it can be fixed, but I really want Samsung to improve. I have been using Samsung from the start. First B5722, then Galaxy Tab 4, then Galaxy Grand Prime and now J7 Prime. Sure, they weren't perfect but there was no regret using them. But now every Samsung phone I see either feels overpriced or just very bad in build quality or just has missing features.

Asafffff,1633513670,"For the past month I've tried ordering a Galaxy Tab S7+ from Samsung's site.  My first order was made on Aug 23rd, I actually had no problems with ordering it. My only problem was that I was out of the country, and couldn't be available for the delivery date. I tried reaching out to FedEx, but they said their hands are tightened, and they can only change shipment details if the shipper asks to do so, so I called Samsung.  I've had multiple chats/phone calls with them, trying to change shipping address / asking to delay the shipment / ask FedEx to hold the package in their facility for a little. All of my requests has been refused due to ""policies"". I actually totally understood that, even though it means I'll have to wait a little bit extra time, wait for a refund, and then re-order, I understood that I'm the actual one to blame.  On September 24th, there was a great Samsung deal on the new tablets. Great discounts and stuff. Their system declined my order 5 times, tried using different credit cards, different payment methods (Credit card, GPay, Paypal..), different shipping addresses, and different billing addresses. Contacting their customer support didn't help of course, as all they could say is ""try again with different information"", ""try again tomorrow"", ""you're doing something wrong"" even though I replicated exactly my steps as I've done with my first order.   Finally, in my 6th attempt, the order went through and was not canceled. I have no idea what was different from the previous orders, and the information and cards were the same. But it did go through, so I didn't care much and was relieved.  Finally, the package was out for shipment. I had multiple delivery attempts, at hours which I'm working and not available at home. I tried again calling FedEx, they redirected me back to Samsung, and they of course weren't helpful at all.   I tried explaining to the representatives that I'm working on these hours, and I won't be able to accept the delivery personally. I wanted to pick it up (like I was able to do with my first order), but they have ordered FedEx to restrict the pickup option. (Reps says pickup is not available for almost 3 months, which is a total lie cause my own order was available for pickup just a month ago). I asked them to contact FedEx and ask the delivery to be dropped at a later time, but they refused to do so as to ""policies"". I've tried thinking of other solutions, like having the order returned to their warehouses, and I'll just re-order to my workplace address, but they are refusing to price match the order (a difference of $300), and they refuse due to policies.  Basically, I've spent 1.5 hours talking with three different representatives. They were all saying the same thing. They didn't even try to help me in this situation. They offered no solution. I've been told just to go to a store and physically buy the product if I'd like, but the price of course will not be matched.  This is the worst customer support I've ever received from a company. I can't understand why they even have customer support if they can do nothing.   I know that I will never order from the Samsung website again. And after owning multiple Samsung products, unfortunately, I'll try seeking alternatives for future purchases.",samsung,I will never order anything from Samsung website again.
proxyswede,1633513664,"Just want to share my experience with Samsung support. I was really happy with my Flip, but it has some issues with the display, so I decided to return it. This is the log of my whole experience, hopefully it will tell you guys what to expect when contacting their support.  \--------------------  15/9 -- calling Samsung and informing them that my Galaxy Z Flip 3 has a faulty screen. It sounds like the display isn’t completely flat, almost like there’s an air bubble under it. Samsung informs me that they will not let me return the phone as I’ve broken it. When I question this, they say “well, if you have an air bubble under your screen, you must have caused that?”. I inform them that I’ve had it since the start and that it’s a factory fault. Customer service informs me that they will send me a shipping slip so that I can return the phone and get my money back.  \--------------------  16/9 -- return slip arrives via email. It’s for an exchange of the phone. Not what I was looking for and not what we decided. Calls Samsung again and they tell me that they will change this, but it has to go to their back office, so it might take a day or two.  \--------------------                                                                                                showing 60 days if you pre-ordered. I check the website via waybackmachine, yes it was saying 60 days. Customer Service says it doesn’t matter since I’ve gotten back to them before the 30 days ended anyway. They tell me to wait for 72h.  \--------------------  20/9 -- no slip. I ask them via Whatsapp. They tell me that their back office doesn’t work weekends, so it’s 72 business hours. “It’s not a promise, it’s an estimate” alright fine, we’ll wait.  \--------------------  22/9 -- still nothing and we’re still waiting on my return slip. I ask them to push through my refund as it’s a lot of money. They decline. I ask to speak to a manager, they say they have requested this but no one has gotten back to me yet. I ask if I can return it to the store (even though it’s a 45 min drive for me, but at least it’s out of my hands then) and they decline. Online orders can only be returned to their online shipping center.  \--------------------  23/9 -- requesting an update via Whatsapp. No one responds.  \--------------------  27/9 -- requesting an update again. They inform me they have no updates yet and ask me to wait.  \--------------------  28/9 -- I ask for a refund again since it’s now 2 weeks. Customer service responds with *“ If you like I can let the internal department know that you are also willing to let us refund your order if it is quicker than an exchange.”* From the beginning, I have wanted a refund, so I make this clear again to the support person. They are gonna forward it to the internal department.  \--------------------  4/10 -- I finally received the slip on my email. I don’t hear anything from support, so I assume the internal department hasn’t informed them that it went out.  \--------------------  5/10 -- I checked with them if they have received the phone. They tell me they have, but will have to decline my request.  *Hey proxyswede! I have received a reply from the internal department. They say that your order was delivered on August 21, the ticket was created on September 16. You have a total of 30 days to register a product for return or replacement.

ibidakhaleesi,1633390744,"Ok don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the phone, the hardware is incredible, the hinge is fantastic and the phone looks gorgeous. My problem is the software. I've always been a massive Samsung fan for years and have had every s phone since the s3 up until the s8. I briefly used an old (and broken) iphone 7 plus whilst I was waiting for my Z Flip and ive got to say im really disappointed at how gimicky the software still is compared to Iphones. Annoying things like torch not working after 5% battery life, stupid volume warnings when turning volume up, all the apps taking a few seconds on the home screen to load when powering/restarting the phone on and doing this really crappy flashing when they do load.   The keyboard seems way harder to use than on iphones as if i slide my fingers across I can press another key resulting in excessive misspellings. And other issues specific to this flip model like the time and battery in the small cover screen moving around every time its turned on and off, there being no settings to control the cover screen and it timing out too quickly to ready any notifcations. Barely any smart usage of the flip, for example if i click the torch notifcation on the cover screen you would expect a small on/off setting instead it just says ""open phone for notification details"" as it says when any other notifcation is pressed on. Barely any apps are optimised to use the flip apart from a few like the camera and gallery app. I would have thought after all this time Samsung would have fixed these software issues.   They are a MASSIVE company and im sure have more than enough spare resources to spend on improving the software on their phones, especially on a phone that costs over a grand. It almost seems as if no one tested the phone when they made it they just rolled it out, and if they did test it they just said: fuck it the software quality is as bad as all the rest of our older phones regardless of them having literal computer specs powering them, even though Apple are signficantly further ahead of us in terms of software smoothness lets focus on other stupid things like Bixby or making crappy ads...",samsung,"Been using my new Z Flip for a couple weeks now, I'm disappointed Samsung..."

He said did I see the phone unsealed in front of me? I said yes. He then said there is little chance of tempering if its sealed.  So why is there so many charges according to him? So does the warranty mean nothing? They said thats why they recommend to purchase directly from authorised samsung dealers and not third party shop. Honestly, if I could get it at authorised dealers I would. But there was no stock everywhere.

----_____--_____----,1633018922,"This guide is specific to mobile devices, but the Battery Health section is applicable to all lithium batteries.   I will cover 2 aspects, battery life aka SoT (""Screen on Time"", the actual amount of time using the phone, as opposed to just on standby), and Battery Health aka charge cycles.   Battery life is based on how you use your phone, battery health is based on battery science and charging habits.    ## **Battery Life (aka SoT):**   Extending battery life is all about using less power, or more specifically, wasting less power. The idea is to be able to use your phone normally and get the maximum SoT by wasting the least amount possible. That means being able to leave on WiFi, data, bluetooth, NFC, 24/7 if you need to.     The biggest users of power is your screen and CPU, which goes hand in hand with background activity in terms of CPU power waste.    Ways to combat this, firstly, maximum screen brightness isn't needed, 50-60% is plenty unless you're in direct sunlight.    1. *Deep sleep ALL apps that you don't need to send you notifications or run in the background*- Examples of apps that SHOULDN'T be set to deep sleep, are messaging apps, social media (if you want notifications), music apps (such as Spotify which you want to still play music with the screen off or locked).   Check all app permissions, if they don't need data, or microphone, or location, then deny it, stop them using things they don't need, both for privacy and to save power.    2. *Use a firewall to block Internet access to all the but apps that need it to function*- we've all got apps and games that run offline but like to send you marketing data, or send usage data off to their servers in the background (im looking at you Facebook). Like above, block them from using it for both privacy and saving power.   I recommend NetGuard as the firewall app, it is an open source application which has no ads. (speaking of ads, those offline games that have ads, blocking their data use can block their ads from showing without paying for the ad free version)    3. *Don't leave tons of apps in the background*- they sit in the RAM consuming power. Android 11 is attempting to fix this, but its not perfect yet, closing down apps from the background should be a good habit. And I don't mean forcing all background apps to quit using the optimisation tool, that closes down other background apps which are needed and they will just start up again, which uses power.    4. *Analyse your usage*- android gives you alot of the tools you need, there's little need for separate apps anymore. You can check the battery usage of apps, data usage, and more through settings and Device Care. Check them, see if they seem realistic, get a feel for what their normal use is and what your normal use is, so if you suddenly get a drain, you are familiar with the normal usage of your most used apps.    5. *Temperature*- ill cover this is more detail in the battery health section, but a hot battery has more resistance, that means normal use requires extra power as some of is it lost as heat. So if your phone is hot, take a break, or take it out of the case.    6. *MACROS*- if there's repetitive things you regularly do on your phone, try using a macro app such as MacroDroid to automate it. This both improves your own productivity and reduces SoT as these will occur in the background.   An example, sending emails, you can use the app to read your notifications, and if an email is from a specific sender or has a specific title or keyword(s), it can send an automated reply for you, saying whatever you want, to whomever.   Another example, photo backups to SD, you can set it up to automatically move or copy a folder X to another folder or location Y, at specific times, or days, or maybe everytime you take a picture, but also only when the battery is above 30%, it is endless.    7. *Lightweight versions of apps, or clients*- this is a more advanced tip as it often requires you to download the apk from unknown sources, do it only if your experienced.   Some apps have lightweight clients that provide most or all of the functionality, but with less bloat, so a smaller app, and also more intelligent data usage such as smart syncing or not doing background processing ""to improve your experience"".    OVERALL, the most important factors is keep background activity to a minimum by following steps 1,2 and 3.  The rest are optional but can help, and of course you have all the basic tips like turning off WiFi, and bluetooth, data, nfc etc. These are small things and generally not considered as waste if you actually use it.   ## **Battery Health (aka charge cycles):**   Some background and key terms:    Lithium batteries have limited charge cycles. Manufactures generally state about 500, for your mobile devices, but this can increase or decrease based on your charging and usage habits. This is relative to the battery capacity dropping to 80%. So 500 charge cycles before its capacity is 80% of what is was when new.    A ""charge cycle"", is 1 complete discharge, and 1 complete charge. This doesn't have to be in 1 go, such as from 100% to 0%, but rather a complete discharge relative to your battery capacity, so once your 4500mAh has used 4500mAhs, and been recharged, it's used 1 cycle. For example going from 100% to 50%, charging back up to 100, and doing it again. That represents a total of 100% discharged and recharged.    Wear in batteries is generally caused by plating at the electrodes, which side will depend on the type of wear its experiencing, for example wear by high C charging causes lithium metal to plate onto the anode. (if you don't understand this sort of thing, don't worry)    These tips are to increase your battery life cycles beyond 500, to over 1000, depending on how many you do. This can mean doubling the life of your battery in the long term! Get yourself an extra year or 2 out of the battery.    1. *Voltage (high)*- lithium batteries don't like to be on the extreme ends of their voltage limits. This means when it's fully charged, its at maximum voltage. Sitting at this voltage damages the battery, an example of this is overnight charging.  A common myth relating to this, is that overnight charging damages the battery because it gets overcharged, and that used to be the case, but now its not (phones will regulate how much current to accept, request voltages from the plug, and also determine whether or not to accept any power at all). But overnight charging is STILL not recommended, it isn't dangerous, it's just not good for the life of the battery. So its fine to charge to 100 if your about to use it.    2. *Voltage (low)*- As said above, lithium batteries don't like to be on the extreme ends of their voltage limits.  A battery charge is low, or empty, when it's voltage drops below a certain level.   If you completely discharge a lithium battery (called a deep discharge) the voltage drops quite low, and causes damage to the battery. Although ""empty"" is 0%, damage can occur above this even upto and exceeding 20%.   3. *Voltage (charge recommendations)*- With point 1 and 2 you can see both ends of the spectrum cause additional wear, but this occurs at all levels, so what is a happy medium? Well, the most optimal value to keep a lithium battery at is about 70%, this can yield in excess of 3000 cycles. But who is gonna do that! Without going into detail, here are the recommended highs and lows.   85% maximum, 20%, minimum, can double your charge cycles. But changing that 20% minimum to a 30% minimum can quadruple it! Personally i keep it between 30% and 85%, and i use a 45w fast charger to give me regular huge bursts in capacity. Its worse to drop below 20 than to go above 85.   My recommendation- 30%-85%. But if you can't or want more, then 20%-85%, or 20%-100%.   4. *Temperature (usage)*- ideally when using your phone, you want the battery temperature to be between 5C and 30C to provide the least amount of battery wear. But this can occasionally rise above 30C, especially in a hot environment. Where you may see upto 40C. 40C should be your maximum before you do significant (but not dangerous) damage to the battery. Dangerous battery temps are 50C+.    5. *Temperature (charging)*- it is common to see your battery temperature rise by upto 10C higher than ambient during a charge, and likw above, ideally you want this between 5 and 30C, but upto 40C is just about acceptable. At 45C the battery SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED as this is dangerous, the phone should automatically stop or refuse to charge above 45C as part of the battery protection.   6. *Depth of discharge*- Doing long discharges and long charges also put additional wear on a battery, lithium batteries respond better to lots of small charges and discharges, around the 70% charge area. There are realistic ways to do this.    Do not rely on the actual cycle values [here](  this graph demonstrates the trend of capacity retention in regards to charging behaviour. Not specifically in small capacity lithium cells such as in a mobile device.    What a good charge/discharge habit looks like?  Lots of smaller charges and discharges rather than long discharges and long charges.     OVERALL, there are numerous tips here, not all have the same effect as eachother, some have a much larger influence over the battery than others. Incorporate what you can, not everyone can do all of these, based on your job, personal preference or usage habits, but try to adjust your habits if you can. And any questions feel free to ask! ",samsung,"Guide: How to increase battery life and battery health, using Lithium battery science!"

gayhomoretard,1632972182,"So a few weeks ago I bought a Tab S7+ from Costco to use as a tablet for handwriting notes and submitting assignments for school. The total came out to a little over $850 for the tablet itself in the 128GB config with the book cover keyboard in Mystic Black.  Recently, Samsung had a promo where you could get the S7+ for a really good price and a pair of Galaxy Buds Pro. Being a college student, I figured I'd take advantage of this as the total for the S7+ from Costco was a little high and I'll take some savings where I could get them given Costco's 90 day return policy on electronics.  I ended up buying the Tab S7+ from Samsung with the Galaxy Buds for $492.79 after tax for the slightly higher spec 256GB version figuring I could get the type cover later and still end up paying less than what Costco had it for.  I was able to get in on the deal and I had received two separate emails regarding the order. One saying that my order was received, and another saying that the order was confirmed and ready to ship. Eager to receive the tablet, I check the status of the order to find out that it had been cancelled without any input from me. I then decided to email Samsung customer support to see what happened with my cancelled order.  In my first interaction, I received an apology that the order was cancelled and that I would be able to re-order and receive a price match for the previous order that had been cancelled once the new order shipped. The rep had sent me a link to a cart with the 256GB Tab S7+ and Buds Pro for about $200 more than what I had paid earlier but I went through with it being assured that I would get a price match.  Once I had received notification that the new order had shipped, I followed the direction of the customer service agent from my last interaction and contacted customer support again. This time the agent again confirmed that I was eligible for a price match and would receive a refund to my payment method in a few days.  However, later that same day, I received another email from the second agent saying that because my first order was cancelled (again, by Samsung, not me), they could not price match. Even with email proof of the first rep telling me they could price match, and a chat transcript from the second rep, they cannot price match my order.  As some form of consolation, Samsung sent out a coupon to all cancelled orders for 40% off of a Tab S7 or S7+ that amounts to MORE EXPENSIVE than the previous promo which also came with the Buds Pro.   So now I have a Tab S7+ from Costco, and a Tab S7+ that Samsung refuses to price match despite confirming to me twice that they would be able to do it. This is incredibly frustrating.

Fiend1138,1632962365,"Long vent incoming.  So on July 14th I arrived home from work. Went into my home office and plugged in my Buds Plus to charge as usual, then headed out to the market.   When I returned home with my groceries I immediately smelled something odd. Like burnt plastic. I pulled a Tucan Sam and followed my nose. I returned to my office to discover that my Buds and case were melting with a thin trail of smoke coming out.   I immediately disconnected it, took it outside because the smell of burnt plastic is just foul, and photographed my blob of a Bud case and contacted support via chat.  They shared in my shock of my Buds essentially blowing up and apologized. I sent over the pictures along with my info. They provided me with a ticket number and told me someone would be in contact within 24 hours.   The next day came and went with no contact from Samsung. I then reached out to them again. Again they apologized and gave me a different number to call to help me as my case was now being escalated to their ""specialized department"".  Called the number I was given only to find out it was just the general Samsung support phone number. OK whatever. I go through the phone process and get connected to support. Support then tells me they have to transfer my call to another department due to the nature of my issue.  My call gets transferred only for it to go to someone's (I'm assuming a support manager) voicemail saying they're out of the office for the day. I leave a message with my info and ticket number.  Three days go by and there is no reply. So again I call the support line. I give them my info and ticket number. I am then told that my ticket has been closed because I did not reply to them. What? I tell them that no one has contacted me. They apologise and reconfirm my information. All of it was correct.  Since my ticket was closed they then have to open and give me second ticket number and then I'm told they will contact me in 24 hours (again?) and if I don't hear back in 48 hours to call back.   48 hours later, you guessed it, I had to call back. Now I'm told that it had been escalated and it will take another 24 hours.   48 hours later I call back because I still had no contact from Samsung. No call, no email, nothing. I get connected to someone and they tell me a replacement has been sent and will arrive in a few days. Finally. Awesome. Or so I thought.   A week goes by and nothing has come in the post. I call to check the status and get a tracking number so I can see what's going on.   The support person then asks me when I sent in my Buds for repair. Repair? Huh? I explained that I was told a replacement was already on the way. I explained that my Buds were beyond repair as they had MELTED. I'm then told that a previous support member must have given me incorrect information and that I first have to send in my bad Buds for Samsung to see if they can be repaired.   FFS. Fine. Whatever. They then tell me that they are sending me a box with a return label and instructions on how to send it back to them and to allow a few business days for it to arrive.   Two weeks go by and a box finally arrives on my porch. I open it up and all that is inside is a return label, a static baggie, and a single blue latex glove (wtf?). No instructions.   Call customer support. Again. They tell me pop the Buds in the static baggie and attach the return label and that the tracking number is tied to my support ticket. OK. Would have been good to know without having to call them.  Send it in and wait. And wait. And wait. Two more weeks go by and I call customer support. They say their technicians are still working on the issue to see if they can be repaired. Which I know obviously they can't. Since they are completely MELTED. I'm told they will let me know when their techs reach their conclusions and if they are sending a replacement they will give me the tracking number.   Another two weeks go by and without any further contact from Samsung, there is a package on my porch. Holy shit. FINALLY.   I open it up and sure enough there is a brand new factory sealed in the box pair of Galaxy Buds Plus. No documentation, nothing other than the box. Although white buds when the blown up ones I sent in were black, but whatever. I'm just happy this fiasco is over.   Or so I thought. I pop them out of the box and charge them up. Flip open the case to pair them but I'm not automatically prompted to (like they are supposed to do). No biggie. Fire up the Galaxy wearable app to add the new divice... ""Device not found"". What?   After having Wearable scan for it multiple times I tried to pair them on my wife's phone, as well as my tablet. Same issue every time.   Call back into support and am told wipe Wearable settings, to reset the Buds, and to let the battery drain fully, recharge and try again. After doing all this it appears that the replacement Buds are defective.   Awesome. Call back to support to tell them. They ask for the serial number on the replacement, I give it to them and they tell me that it is out of warranty.   I ask them how that can be when they literally just arrived straight from Samsung. They say they'll escalate the issue. I'm then given a new ticket number. By now this is my 3rd or 4th ticket number.   Support then tells me that they will send me an email containing a shipping label for me to return them. I receive an email with my ticket information, but there is no shipping label attached.   I call back the next day and am told I will receive the shipping label in 24 hours. And to call back if I don't receive it after 24 hours. More than 24 hours have passed and I am about to call back for what feels like the millionth time.

z0diark88,1632871796,"*Long-post warning*  I love**d** Samsung. IMO, Samsung makes the best and innovative hardware. Its typically enough to make-up for their bloatware forced upon everyone (Bixby anyone)? But the last few months have just been absolute customer-service hell that I really can't ignore or even comprehend. I'll summarize the saga here:     * **Watch-4 | Preordered 08/12 |** Most folks who about the shipping debacle by now. Shipping dates perpetually pushed back, now to mid-Oct. Order stuck in ""Preorder"" stage meaning they have not taken any action on the order. Requested to cancel in mid-Sep, and they cancelled ***only*** the watch ***strap*** but not the watch itself. When asked why, they said its already in process so its not possible to cancel (*despite showing otherwise that nothing is done on the order*). Other posters showed their watch orders have Samsung literally break the new-product seal to remove the strap itself... Someone logical might think a watch without a strap is obsolete, but not Samsung. Since they cancelled the strap, I asked to reverse it then - but they said its too late, that strap is gone. Their genius solution was to wait that 2-3 months to get the watch shipped, return the watch for a refund, order a new watch with strap, and wait another few weeks to get that processed...     * **Buds-2 |** **Preordered 8/12 |** This was received but supposedly must be returned with the missing Watch-4 since they were ordered together. It'll be outside the return window when the Watch is actually delivered. If keeping it, they will charge the full value of the Buds-2 if the Watch is returned. Essentially a lose-lose. Samsung is confused. I also found out a pretty sketchy practice (see below).    * **Fold-3 | Attempted Order |** Decided to give it another go and make a $2k+ order for Fold-3 and several accessories. Charged my credit-card only for the order to be cancelled moments later. Tried again, same thing. Asked why, and they said they can't deliver it to my home address (in Redmond, WA, USA. When pointing out that they delivered several Samsung products to my home in the past, there was no issue. No response other than to try again at a later time. Tried again next-day, same issue - they just won't ship it to my home.    * **Flip-3 | Ordered 9/1 - Delayed 4x |** Okay, 4th time the charm right? Ordered a Flip-3 on Google Fi now for the Fi Credits. Must be better since it's Google shipping it and not Samsung. I was wrong. As it gets closer to the posted '**Delivered By Date**', it keeps getting delayed. The latest one pushed it out by another 2 weeks with no guarantee it won't be pushed out again.     * **Galaxy Tab S7 | Cancelled but Charged |** Time to celebrate the Samsung Discover event. Ordered a Tab S7 during the event and paid through financing. Order was mysteriously cancelled with zero explanation why - but my card was still charged.  **Sketchy business practices, some probably unlawful:**  * **Refusal to refund, holding hostage your order** \- The agreed terms and conditions of your order not being upheld means you should be able to get a refund - I would say a 2-3 month delay with no action taken on your order would qualify for it being outside your original terms at purchase. * **Credits / Promo Codes are misleading** \- When they cancelled my Watch-4 Strap, it was effectively losing $50 since it was bundled with the Watch and wasn't refunded. I had to ***proactively*** ask about this at which point they agreed to give me a $50 promo code to buy a new one. I was okay with this, but then when I went and tried to use my promo code, I was confused why my overall balance wasn't really going down that much. Then I realize that the the promo-code was applied against one item (reducing the price by $50), the other items in the cart ***increased*** in price. What the \*\*\*\*? It was so unbelievable, I took screenshots. * **Cancelling orders without refunding** \- This doesn't need explanation. If they cancel orders, customers shouldn't need to go out of their way inquiring to get their money back. * **First to Order, Last to Get** \- This one grinds my gear the most. Knowing that for a long time, brand new orders from customers were being shipped right away yet some who pre-ordered very early on still haven't even gotten theirs shipped. Logistically makes zero sense.",samsung,Giving up on Samsung completely

Got an amazing deal due to all the fuss about the Z Fold 3, ended up saving about $900 on my order. Order went through fine, next day I get an email from Samsung saying my shipment is on backorder, and it will take a month to get everything in my order.  I think, fine I get it. Chip shortage, Fold/Flip fuss. I call Samsung just to make sure that everything is good to go. Person tells me they have everything in stock, just going to take time to get it all to me (flag #1) I say ok and that's it.  2 weeks later, no update on my order status. Got an email from Samsung saying they wanted to ""update me"" on my shipment, and reassured me I would get my order on time. 1 week later, exactly the same email. Another week, another email. Still no changes. (Flag #2)  I call Samsung again, now getting worried. They tell me it will ship on time, and in advance put an expedite on my order (active duty military perk I guess) and tell me everything is fine and that now I should get it earlier than expected. Sounds great. (Flag #3)  Last week, get an email saying sorry your order has been over 30 days, but it will ship on the date mentioned in your order status. Call AGAIN to reaffirm everything. Person tells me they see the expedition, no issues, im good to go.  This brings me to today. No movement on my order. It was supposed to arrive today or tomorrow. Still says backordered. I call, and they tell me the system now says Oct 4th, but he cannot guarantee that date. I start to get upset, explaining to him all the previous encounters I had with Samsung. He tells me he understands... Poor guy, I know its not his fault. He then explains to me that yes my order is ""expedited"" but he cannot tell me in any good faith when I will actually get it.  I'm not even mad that it's taken this long to get my order, I understand that sometimes you just don't have it. They can't pull a phone out of the clouds for me. What bothers me is the constant emails with no real update. The constant reassurance that my order will indeed ship and nothing to back that up. Telling me it's in stock and it's not. Telling me it's expedited with no stock in sight.   I'm going on a business trip in 2 weeks, I would have liked to have my items before my trip. If it's not set by then, I fear it being at my doorstep for a couple of weeks (could get stolen or heat damaged, I live in Arizona it's still 90+ degrees every day) or it sitting in my mailbox for the same time and being subject to heat exposure and it breaking and then me going through this all over again.  What would you guys/gals do in this situation? Cancel order and get something else? Stick it out and just wait until it gets to you?",samsung,S21 Ultra backorder

But with Samsung it's much more complicated, you have to one drive for photos, one note for notes, Google for app data (which most of the time doesn't transfer the actual data of the app) if you got a separate launcher, you have to back up your launcher settings manually on google drive. Then there's the actual Samsung cloud which backs up your contacts and calendars.

The issue is almost not noticeable in bright scenes but as soon as the image gets dark, the issue is noticeable.  I was shocked that such an expensive TV can't deal better with subtitles.

neomancr,1632661837,"I thought the auto ducking feature was neat where it'd lower the volume when you speak then raise back up when you stop talking was pretty cool but still disruptive. I can just leave it at regular volumes now and still talk to people like the music like I'm at a club or something.  Does it only work for the Buds pro? Has anyone else tried it with the regular Buds or beans etc?  Im outside now and I can hear the wind and a car every now and then. I was never really sold on wireless and still would prefer the ability to plug in my headphones but this type of tech is really more compelling than I thought it'd ever be.  For solo practice you can use them as a click track and still hear everyone including yourself play at the same volume. It's amazing. You can even play along to music and the audio from your Amp mixes right in.  I have a theory that they're preparing to bring sound camp back.  All the set up to get this possible required the zero latency audio processing that was introduced back on the note 4 with Samsung pro audio, which then allowed for multiple channels to run at once so you could chain multiple effects together. Then sound assistant let you reroute audio to an external source while your phone still worked as it's own independent source.  They even added a channel zero that was interruptable you can assign a music app to then mute the ingame music (or annoy your ""friends"" by piping your gaming music to a Bluetooth speaker in the other room while you listened to your own music and they had to listen to you play while you could just listen to your own music and play the game to your own music thus forcing them to enjoy the music from the game while you enjoyed your own music and played the game.  Works for porn too so they can hear all the sounds and you just listen to Depeche mode, your own musical porn. Then leave the porn playing while you play the game and no one watches the porn, but your friends have to listen to it and you get to listen to music and play your game.   I think it was only then that Samsung realized it was play to remove the audio jack. That and the ability to split whatever you're listening to to two Bluetooth headsets at once so you can both watch a movie, and stream audio from the porn through the phones speakers so everyone thinks you and your significant other are just loudly watching porn while in fact you're just watching suicide squad on both headphones and can't even hear the sound from your phone due to the ambient noise cancelation.

All these works really well but I am planning to replace my Tab A with S Pen 2019.  I don't need a big tablet and sadly that latest Samsung Tablets are getting bigger and bigger. I mostly use my tablet for working. I am a clinical staff in hospital. Carrying a huge tablet around the wards in the hospital is tiring.

jakehopt,1632599604,"And good Lord am I in love. It's such an ambitious idea. So previously I've been a big iOS guy. I've owned almost every MAJOR iteration of the iPhone; not every model but just about every big JUMP between say, 4 *skipped 4S* and I'd get a 5, then skip the 5S and eventually jumped to the 6S Plus, etc.   Well about a year ago I picked up the Motorola RAZR, because foldable screens seemed like the COOLEST Phone tech since the first touch screens were released. I've been pretty dissapointed with the lack of innovation in Apple since the iPhone X *Which I did really like, and felt like a leap in the right direction towards bezel-less screens*.   Well fast forward to today; I was watching MHB's review on the Fold 3, and like I typically do I get really excited about something, have poor impulse control and immediately hopped in my car and drove up to AT&amp;T to pick one up.  So besides it being the single most expensive phone I've ever held, it's absolutely worth $1,800 for the 256 GB version I picked up. The 6.2 inch screen when folded is pretty solid, definitely feels weird to type on because the aspect ratio is really skewed strangely TALL lol. Especially for people used to NORMAL 16:9 type wideness. But I cannot express how COOL it feels to fold it out to it's full 7.6 inch side with the TWO 120Hz foldable screen setup.   I took a couple pics with the 12 megapixel rear cameras then started scrolling through them in FULL 7.6 inch glory and MAN it's a cool feeling. You really do feel like you're holding something special. So is it for everyone? Nah, certainly not. Is it too pricey? Hell yeah; I mean it's more expensive than the average laptop hahaah.    But I love the shit out of it; there's just something about being on the BLEEDING edge of technology in the phone market that get's my engine going. Especially with Foldable tech; I love every aspect of it. Even the weird quirks you ahve to deal with. I mean in the search for the ultiamte FOLDABLe experience you lose a little bit of the regular PHONE experience that other phones are just plain BETTER at doing. Battery Life being a serious one, this thing CHUGS battery. And being slightly less thick than the Fold 2, it's got a SLIGHTLY smaller battery to boot, so it certainly doesn't help. But I've got a CHUNKY case on it's way, will be here tomorrow from Amazon via Prime Shipping so I'm really excited to have this thing as my daily driver. I'm a programmer for a commercial HVAC company and do a LOT of work with my phone, mainly texting, emails, and a little bit of remote Teamviewer access depending on how much of a hassle it is to pull out my laptop at any given time.

But one thing I do not like is the fingerprint sensor. Half the time it works flawlessly, and the other half of the time it's just terrible... Sometimes it won't even register that I'm trying to unlock the phone for a solid 3+ seconds. I'll press my finger to the sensor 5-6 times and no unlock, no animations, nothing. Then when it does actually register that I'm trying to unlock the phone, it just has a hard time reading my fingerprint. I do have the factory screen protector on, but that shouldn't be having any effect on the fingerprint sensor. And if it is then that's alarming because I'm planning on replacing it with a different screen protector because the one that comes on the phone from factory is absolutely terrible, and almost a slap in the face by Samsung.

(the only thing I recall is the next iteration of it was rumored to have exploding batteries)  I have bounced around to the google pixel, a sting of LG and xperia phones, and finally now my Huawei P30 pro. Now my phone contract is nearly up and I am thinking of going back to Samsung, and the flip and fold look like the right level of a bit weird/gimmicky but also like they suit my specific phone habits pretty well.  **Points I have seen that I don't think will bother me:**  * The battery life of the phones isn't a huge sticking point for me, since I do charge my phone every night, and I always carry a charger with me anyway * I have used a phone with a shattered screen, held together only by a screen protector, the crease will not bother me * I tend to not take many pictures unless it's of peoples pets, so camera quality isn't massively important unless the quality is 2008 digital camera quality.  **What I think I will personally like for the Fold 3**  * Weirdly specific as it sounds I think the tablet mode might actually make keeping track of things while I'm playing DnD a lot easier, though the multiple windows feature will be generally useful for the way I use my phone currently. * Clip studio paint is available for android, and having a tablet I can sketch ideas on, in a program I know, that I don't need to find wifi to back up will be fantastic. * More portable than an actual tablet, with most (if not all) of the features I look for in a tablet. * The compatibility with the pen is something I have never had with a phone, and something I am very curious to try.  **The main drawbacks for me and my lifestyle with the Fold 3**  * It looks like it's pretty big, and I like to have my phone on me at work, even when wearing outfits with small or no pockets and have to put it in my apron. I've had fairly large phones in the past, but I don't know if the thickness of the phone will be noticeable or not.  * back when I had a keyboard slide phone (LG rumor, and some blackberry knockoff) I had a habit of unconsciously flicking it open and closed. Granted, this was back in high school and I've developed better ways to fidget, but I do worry I might fall into that habit again, though not as bad with the fold as with the flip.  **What I think I will personally like with the Flip 3**  * The size it flips down to is what got me into looking at both of these phones in the first place. Having the ability to check my phone quickly without pulling out 'the whole phone' will likely help prevent me from getting as distracted by it, and has the added benefit of not looking like I'm checking my messages at work. * It won't be as big of a change as the Fold. Sure it will flip shut, but when using it as a phone, I doubt I will have to do much adjustment in how I handle it.  **The main drawbacks for me and my lifestyle with the Flip 3**  * As stated in the drawbacks with the Fold, I do wonder if the temptation to fidget with it will be bad for it, and the smaller size will make it much easier to do. * This is a very specific to me drawback, but since it is so small when it's closed, I do fear that I will lose it far more often and easily. It will be able to blend in with things better, and fit in smaller places. I also typically keep my phone on vibrate, and when I borrow someones phone to call it, I look for the screen lighting up as much as I listen for the vibrations.

bubba_booey69,1632017008,"Been with Apple my whole life but very interested in the s21U due to its slew of features. My queries are:  1.	What is customer service like when experiencing issues? I’ve always loved that I can book a Genius Bar appointment with Apple instantly and chat with someone in person about my options.  2.	Longevity. My iPhone X has been going strong for some time, the sheer amount of Samsung phones released a year makes me slightly uneasy about a commitment to quality (I know nothing of this topic so I may be concerned over nothing here)  3.	Smoothness of use / day to day experience: the Apple experience is one I’m comfortable with, I’m quite tech savvy so I’m open to all the new Samsung technological options but concerned it’ll impact the smoothness and ease of use that I’ve been so used to w Apple.   4.	Security / viruses, Apple have outstanding protection from malware and viruses which I’ve heard is something I’ll need to be more careful with on Samsung’s.   5.	Is it worth purchasing an s21 ultra (seems to be the flagship, which I want) or waiting for the 22 as it’ll likely be in the close future and I’m happy waiting.

maddycow,1631979666,"I'm a staunch Android user. Every phone I've had has been Samsung, and I've never had an issue that wasn't expected. (I.e. my last phone started to chug after about four years, which is fine.)   I bought a brand new replacement in February: the S21 Ultra. I've had no issues with it, and sing its praises all the time. It's never been dropped, scratched, bumped, or gotten wet. Perfect condition. Until this morning, after using it for a few minutes, I got the Black Screen of Death.   And quickly learned this is a common issue. I trouble-shot, tried everything on the Internet, and have come to the conclusion the phone needs to go to repair. Annoying. Embarrassing for Samsung (the phone is four months old, how under-qualified are your engineers?). But OK, fine. Thing is, I'm an American working in Milan, Italy.   Although Apple and many, many, most companies support official repair from brand employees under warranty, Samsung absolutely, entirely 100% does not. Word is this is to prevent people from buying cheaper phones in foreign countries, while expecting perks of their warranty where the phone would be more expensive. But I don't really care. I didn't do that. And that's kind of their problem, not mine.  I reached out to support, where I was promptly told there are plenty of official Samsung repair shops and personnel where I'm located. Perfect. The chat even offered to help me make an appointment. But of course, this will not be covered, because I'm not in the U.S. Therefore, my options are to pay out of pocket (hundreds of euros, more in USD) to have it repaired and—that's all they can do. Oopsie, my bad for trusting Samsung to build a product that won't be inherently flawed and break within months. I could also pay to send it back to the U.S., presuming I have a contact there to receive it, take it in for repair, and pay to send it back (but don't worry, Samsung is in no way responsible for damage during shipping!).   I asked for the simple coverage of the warranty. No dice, because Italy doesn't honor foreign warranties, and neither does Samsung. I asked for the expensive repair to be reimbursed, as I had trusted the product to be basically qualified (just for a few months, at least, right?). Nope. The product can't be rebated, reimbursed, or repaired, despite falling under the purview of the warranty and basic implied warranty laws.   I was thrown around department after department, yelled at, manipulated, and played with. And at the end of the day, I'm stuck with a broken phone I did not break, incidental damages in that I have no access to work, have to miss work for the repair, have to find a babysitter so I can miss work to fix a lazy company's 'mistake' (is purposefully hocking bad merchandise a mistake?), and must pay, out of pocket, hundreds of additional dollars to have it repaired.   The employees I spoke with were glib, disrespectful, and useless. It was clear they were speaking from a script, and that they've encountered this issue before, probably often. I will never, ever buy another Samsung product again. And you can bet I'll be dissuading everyone else, too. I can't afford to fix this phone, miss work, or not work. Tons of people are in that boat, or worse. Samsung does not care about its customer. It doesn't care that it's selling falsely advertised products, reneging on implicit warranty, or f\*\*\*\*\*\* people out of more money than they agreed to pay, and all because their products are sub-par and by nature defective. Their customer service is a limp bureaucracy of careless, script-reading robots.  My point is simply, don't buy from Samsung. Their warranties, products, and customer service are an absolute joke. And if you think this is a one-off, it's not. Tons of people have had issues with Samsung's customer service, including with the international warranty (and lack thereof). If you're going to sell a product that can't fulfill its basic purpose, you shouldn't be allowed consumers. It's immoral and pathetic, and there are plenty of superior brands to buy from. As soon as I can, I'm selling my phone and buying an iPhone.   Happy Saturday!",samsung,"Longtime Samsung User, Switching to Apple After International Warranty Debacle"

I also have been recommending everyone to get an iPhone. And, yes I have been using various iPhones in the past 5 years (5s, 7plus, and 11).  I switched because,  1. The design of Z flip 3 is just gorgeous.  2. 120hz, bright and big screen.  3. Can fold!   But mainly because, I started to feel like I am trapped.

So, I pre-ordered my Fold 3 on the Samsung eShop, and it arrived early. The 23rd of August I was able to pick it up from the pick-up point. Everything was great. Exactly one week later, the 30th of August, the Wi-Fi wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought, no big deal, Samsung Experience Center is 10 minutes away, they'll repair the device or give me a new one...  Boy, was I wrong. They did not have spare parts to repair the device, so I was told to contact customer support. Customer support said I should make an appointment to pick up the phone for repairs online. So I did. A bike courier came, picked up my phone, and brought it to the exact same Samsung Experience Center, where they didn't have parts. I got contacted by a manager of the Experience Center shortly after, saying I could pick up my phone the next day, and that I should call customer support to get them to do a Dead On Arrival process, since the Wi-Fi died within a week.  Alright, no big deal, I'll send my phone to Samsung, and they'll send me a new one, right? So after picking up my phone and printing my RMA label, I sent it to Samsung. This was the 1st of September. The 2nd of September I got an e-mail that a new Galaxy Z Fold 3 would be on it's way. It had no working track-and-trace code, and after a few days, it said that it had been delivered and that I picked it up, even though this wasn't the case.  So I call customer support again. They would ""make a ticket"" and the eShop team would resolve it. I received no communication regarding the status of this ticket, so I was left completely in the dark. I was fortunately able to contact Samsung through WhatsApp on Friday the 10th of September and I explained the situation again and he created a new ticket. Every other day I asked for the status of the ticket, but so far, ""the eShop department is very busy, and we're dependant on them"" is the only status update I get. I am now without a phone for over 2 weeks, and if they just had spare parts or were able to give me a new device at the Samsung Experience Store, I wouldn't be in this mess.

Dogrules23,1631770464,"Well, I’m jumping ship from Apple (see Discord’s forced changes and a lack of real innovation for root causes). Anyway, I’m switching to a Z Flip3 soon-ish and I’m looking for some info/advice on the switch.   I’m very used to iOS as a phone OS, I’ve been with them since the 5C so it’s all I’m used to now. Before that, my experience with Android was a Pantech Burst that was garbage. It tainted my view of Android for a long time. This will be my first Android phone since roughly 2013 and I imagine a lot has changed.   So, first, what are some key differences between iOS and Android that will impact how I use my new phone? For some context, I use the “Reduce White Point” on my iPhone along with Dark Mode which saves a TON of battery. Does Android have something similar to the white point thing? I imagine it has dark mode.   Next, is there a tool or something to move pictures and other things over from iOS to Android? I’d rather not have to start all over and lose tons of pictures or need to remember/reset passwords.   Music sources. On my iPhone, I currently use Apple Music. I’ve used Spotify in the past as well. Is Spotify the only option on Android or is there something else that’s better?  Finally, what are some good case manufacturers? I know Otterbox, Speck, and Spigen for iPhone, but what ones make cases for the Z Flip3 that I can trust? Side note, I’ve noticed most clear cases for iPhones allow dirt to get underneath them and then they look gross, does that hold true for clear Z Flip3 cases too?

guitaristnate,1631735624,"On February 18th, 2020, I picked up a Samsung 70” UN70NU6900FXZA UHD 4k TV from Walmart. Since I’ve had this TV, it’s had a problem, in which it’ll repeatedly turn itself on and off without a visible picture (the screen remains black during this). The red power button flashes when this happens. The problem usually goes away after 20 minutes of being unplugged, and the TV becomes watchable again. Since I was able to fix it by leaving it unplugged, I didn’t initially reach out to Samsung support. It had been several months since I had an occurrence of this. A few months ago, this problem started back up and the TV became unresponsive. When plugged in, the TV just cycles back and forth between on and off with a black screen. It stopped responding to my remote or any reset command and is in a permanent state of powering on and off repeatedly to a blank screen. This TV was purchased a little more than a year and a half ago, and isn’t functioning due to a defect. I’ve kept it in pristine condition and it doesn’t even have a scratch on it. I spoke to a customer service representative who informed me that it was unfortunately a few months out of the one year warranty, but made the accommodation of scheduling a one time courtesy servicing. I was emailed two days ago that the service was cancelled and I had to call to find out why. A representative informed me that they didn’t have the part to fix my television (how did they know that they didn’t have the part if they haven’t seen it yet?) and instead would have someone contact me to offer either a refund or a replacement. I spoke to a representative today who informed me that they do not have a TV to replace my defective set with, and because of depreciation can only offer me a partial refund. How convenient! A pro-rated refund, and I still don’t have a functional TV.   To sum this up, my less than two year old Samsung TV that I purchased new from a retailer, and have kept in “like new” condition, is defective. And because it’s a few months out of warranty, there’s nothing that can be done, besides offer me a “curtesy” pro-rated partial refund.   I feel like I have been scammed by this company. Samsung customer service gave me a complete runaround, and kept assuring me that there was something they could do to get my TV (the defective product) working. In the end, all I was offered was a partial refund of my money, and I still don’t have a working TV — a TV that I bought a little more than a year ago.",samsung,Consumer Beware of Samsung TV’s!

After I got my refund for the 46mm I noticed that Samsung had refunded me Rs.35,999 instead of the Rs.38,999 which had been debited from my bank account. After seeing hat I contact Samsung customer care and they told me that they would take care of it and I'll get my Rs. 3000 back to be that were missing. However I never got any follow back from them nor did I get my Rs.3000 back to this day.

Lvl100Waffle,1631581255,"Hi all! I got a S21+ about 3 months ago, and after only a month, the hardware in the screen randomly failed, and had to be replaced. A certified repair place replaced the screen under warranty, but didn't seal it back onto the phone properly. Now, there's a noticeable slit between the phone screen and body, where water/sand/lint could easily get in the phone. It took me a while to notice this because my case obscured the gap, but now I'm seriously concerned about the long term health of my phone.   The screen failing after only a month was already a big red flag about this device's hardware, and now a decent amount of lint has gotten into the phone during the time it took me to notice the repair mistake.

Problems with the lint or the compromised water resistance might not manifest until I'm already out of warranty.

Ill_Fan_1965,1631580864,"Had the z flip 3 for two weeks now and here are some thoughts.  Came from an iphone 12 for reference. This was not my first time with android so I don't consider myself a rookie lol.  I will say going from IOS to Android can take some getting used to. There's alot of similarities, but the extra customization of Android can be overwhelming at first.  As for the phone itself, I love it. The build is really solid. Im interested in seeing how it hold up over time. So far no issues at all.  Things I love: * The front display. Great to just check notifications on the fly if needed. *The main screen. It's big and beautiful. Just note the aspect ratio is odd. For example, on Snapchat your photos will be cropped when sent to others. At least that's what people have mentioned when getting pics from me on there. Also I find the center crease to not really be an issue. I notice it way less than the notch on my iphone. Feels weird at first, but you get used to it.  *It's fast! Snapdragon 888 is great. No performance issues. * The cameras. I feel like there's a ton of chatter about the camera quality. I'd say it's on par with the iphone 12 I came from. Are you gonna get Pro Max, or S21ultra quality photos? No, but they are still good photos.   Things that could be better: *The battery. Easily it's biggest weakness. Now my battery tests are alittle skewed because it's charging in my car to/from work so I can use Android Auto. But this thing drains fast. *It's fat. As exciting as it is to not have a full 6.7in phone in your pocket, this thing still feels alittle odd in the pocket. It sticks out. I don't know how they will fit a bigger battery in there in the future. It's big as it is currently * This next one is more Android than the phone itself, but Android Auto is straight trash. Apple carplay might be the thing I miss most from my iphone 12. It's just significantly better. Android Auto is slow, buggy, and dated. They really need to fix the issue of phones disconnecting. It seems to be getting worse by the day.   Overall I'm glad I made the switch. The phone does Garner alot of questions and intrigue from friends and coworkers. It's a nice device.

I'm really sorry for violating the rules but I really need the help. Yesterday my two year old Samsung Note 8 fell onto the ground and the outer screen has been broken. The touchscreen works fine. The cracks in the screen is kind of annoying though. I was thinking of replacing the screen but it costs too much. I watched videos where people only change the glass part of the screen, it looks kind of dangerous and if it is not done right the screen underneath might crack etc. I don't know if I can trust people with that. It might lower the trade price. Also I doubt the water and dust resistance would survive if only the outer screen is changed. The other option is changing the whole screen and paying between 1,5k-2k (my country's money). (Obviously I would have to use the phone until I graduate, so at least for 3 years.) If I do that will the water and dust resistance remain? Third option is trading this Note 8 with cracked screen and getting a Note 10 Lite. Of course I will have to pay more than 3,5k (my country's money) for that to happen. Since I'm a student my budget is limited. If I can wait a few months I might get Samsung S20FE. I don't know if the screen will hold until then though. Overall what I will miss about Note 8 will be the dust and water resistance. I tend to clean my phone with alcohol several times a day due to Covid and since I'm going to be in the hospital this year I don't want to give up on the water resistance. Also ability to connect my phone to tv via HDMI is also a plus but I have an iPad for that. I don't really care about the phone's outer material since I will use it with phone cases. Camera is of course really important. I don't really play games on my phone but I wouldn't want a phone that lags while using more than a few apps. What do you think I should do?

w0Lverine13,1631418635,"A little back story:  So I own OnePlus 6 and I've been using this for more than 2.5 years already (my phone before this is Sony Xperia Z5) and one thing I don't like about this phone is that it has a very slightly yellowish screen/display. Even if I adjusted the display settings to show the cooler tones, it still is a bit yellowish compared to my previous phone (Xperia Z5) which has a really balanced &amp; really bright screen color.   Now: I bought an S21 plus a few weeks back, but I seldom use it because my OP6 is still functioning well and also I'm a bit lazy to transfer all data &amp; apps to my new phone. I sometimes use my S21 plus to watch Youtube videos or Netflix.  Just a few moments ago I watched a YT video on both phones simultaneously, and noticed how pale the video looks on my S21 plus compared to my OP6. Idk why but I like how vivid the video appears on my OP6, the video on my S21+ appears to be too pale even though the display settings is already on Vivid (both phones are on 50% screen brightness, but S21+ screen appears to be a bit dimmer). idk if it's just because I got used to the screen settings of my OP6, but still. You'll immediately recognize a better display once you saw (or watched something from) it, right?  I'm wondering why is it like that, supposedly S21 plus has a better display. Does anybody ever notice this? I also tried to watch a test video on both phones for comparison, and OP6 really gave a very vivid &amp; vibrant display compared to S21+. I don't know, maybe OP6 is oversaturating the colors, maybe the S21+ is true to reality, idk. But comparing screen brightness and display colors (how vivid images &amp; videos appear) I'm really wondering why I like OP6's display more. I'm worried also that maybe there's something wrong with my S21+? Or it could also be because of the tempered glass I installed on S21+? Both phones have tempered glass btw. S21+ has Spigen tempered glass &amp; OP6's tempered glass has no brand, just bought it online.  Anybody has the same issue?",samsung,S21 plus screen color's a bit.. pale? Advice?

The1963,1631411141,"Tldr: Netflix like service but for phones.   Now hear me out. I'm extremely high and probably not thinking straight, but what if phone companies also had a subscription service for their phones like Netflix and other streaming services.   Let me set the scene:  The new Galaxy X Paper is getting ready to be put up for preorder. The first phone that people can wear on one of their appendages. You're sitting on your couch, looking at your phone, and waiting for the preorder button to pop up. It finally does.   But you notice at checkout that there's another payment method available: Galaxy Now!  The pitch:  Samsung and other phone giants have created their own subscription services based around their phones, and each tier has a different phone. So, instead of paying 1k+ for a phone, you pay like 20-35 USD equivalent a month for the phone. Here's the thing: after one year, when they release a new phone, you get to upgrade and get the new phone for the same price you were already paying within that tier bracket.   Now, I know what you're thinking, ""but that's just like buying a phone and paying it off with a monthly plan!"" Here's the thing: it's just like Netflix and other streaming platforms. Once you no longer want to be part of the subscription, you just cancel. You have the option to finish your one year cycle and then send it in, send it back immediately, or if you really fell in love with the phone, you can just pay off the full price minus what you paid during the subscription.   It's just like Xbox All Access, but instead of a console, it's a phone. I feel like this would open the door to so many people who don't have the opportunity to buy a phone with a premium price. And if you don't like it, you can cancel the subscription, send it back, and just go to another company and get their subscription.   And when I say tiers, it would be something like this:  Galaxy s22 - 20 USD equivalent a month Galaxy s22+ - 25 USD equivalent a month Galaxy s22 ultra - 30 USD equivalent a month Galaxy Z Flip 3 - 35 USD equivalent a month  So based on the price of the phone, the subscription tier goes up to since it's a more premium phone. And you could also tag a Samsing Care service on as well, like an extra 5 bucks a month in case the phone gets damaged.   This sounds like an awesome idea to not only increase a customer base, but really open the doors to experimenting with phones and what not. No longer do you have to sit around and ponder whether you're willing to cut this months rent for your new phone, it simply lays snuggly in between all you other subscription.",samsung,Galaxy Now: a subscription service for phones for people who don't want to pay the premium price.

No flagship made from here on out should lack dual speakers as it’s a must. The 120hz display makes the phone feel premium.

Another target audience is tech enthusiasts who get this…. Are always on their phones!!!!  I just can’t understand why a larger battery wasn’t in store? Every YouTube reviewer and myself agree.

However, I can also get a refurbished or used Z Fold 2 from eBay for only about $1100-$1200. The Z Fold 2 seems like it would be considerably more useful, being as that it can fold out into a large tablet, and even has some advantages over the last model (slightly larger battery, cameras seem about the same, and the underdisplay camera on the 3 hurts my eyes).

Latter_Border_6051,1631379021,"Hi, everyone!  I'm looking to buy myself a new phone, and from searching around the net, I think the Poco F3 and Galaxy A52S are my best choices.  I am however, in a bit of a dilemma because I'm not sure which of these two phones should I take. All that I care about in a new phone is that it has a good battery that can last at least a day before needing to be recharged, and a phone that can be used for as long as possible before I have to buy a new one. Hardware is not so much important to me because both phones have great specs that are overkill for my use cases.  Speaking of which, my usage on the phone is pretty casual. Aside from the couple of calls I make and the texts I send, I mostly spend my time web browsing and watching YouTube videos. I don't play video games, or do any camera work, so any advantage each phone has in these areas can be ignored.  As far as I can see, the F3 has superior CPU, GPU and two more gigabytes of RAM, but with a buggier OS, whereas A52s has more software updates, better IP rating, and a bit more stable OS.  Nonetheless, I really don't know which of these two would be better for me to take, seeing how both of them have great batteries, the only thing left is that in terms of futureproofing, does F3 having a stronger CPU and additional memory have an advantage, or is the A52S better because of the more support it gets?",samsung,A52S vs. Poco F3?

Don't get me wrong, I love Samsung, but the way they handle software updates makes me furious.  First of all, I never even decide to download the update - it just downlaods it on it's own.  If it's downloaded it randomly just literally opens up the settings app saying that I shourd update. Like I'm doing stuff on my phone, stop interrupting me!  But it gets a lot worse. Sometimes, when I turn my phone on, it brings up that shit ""update available for install"" thing I just mentioned, and when I click on like the arrow to go batk, IT FUCKING MAKES THE UPDATE. Seriously. I click away but it just decides to fucking baken the update. Once it started there is no going back. You can't restart the phone. You have to wait at least 15 minutes for it to finish the uptades, while all you can do is staring at your phone angrily begause you never even decided to let it update.   Like, imagine if I needed to call an ambulance. This thing only seems to happen when I unlock my phone (not even after a restart, junh after a normal unlock), so it isn't even a very unlikely thing to happen.

Only works well with Samsung Autofill. Anything else is hit or miss unless you enable the Accessibility service. It works if I restart the browser and then stops working after a few mins.

NotIansIdea,1631199302,"I got the Galaxy s8 as soon as it launched, and I'm still using it (in fact, I'm writing this post on it right now). It's getting slow, and I'm due for an upgrade.

Jonlife,1631153200,"Been using this fold 3 as my daily driver for two weeks and I'd like to announce, this device is the real deal.  My biggest fears of trading my s21 ultra for this device were that I'd never utilize the purpose of why they built this. I never used the stylus with every note phone I had and was worried that would be the case with this device in terms of both displays, and I can happily report that both of these displays serve a great purpose for me.  Yes the smaller display could be bigger but it's definitely functional if you need to use it. Once they make it a 6.4 or 6.5 inch display it'll be perfect. I use the smaller display for driving or when I need to look up something real quick. It's not hard to open it up and use the larger display but I would not recommend it in public because you're gonna get bombarded with questions.  The larger display is awesome for when you're lounging and have time to open it up without any issues or people staring at you.  The battery life was another issue I was worried about and honestly it's not bad at all. If you're worried about not being able to charge it for a long time just use the smaller screen, battery life on the smaller screen is amazing. On the larger screen though it will drain in 4 hours or less.  When I'm out and about the utility this device provides is legit. When it's folded the thickness makes it real easy to hold and text one handed. People crying about it being too thick when folded haven't used one. I have no issue putting it in my gym shorts when I'm going for a walk.  The s21 ultra felt way too wide in my pocket not too mention hard to hold with one hand (even though I would still do it because my hands are big). It's also very comfortable holding it to your ear while folded.  I can't say enough about how easy it is to hold. When you unfold it you know it's time for two handed usage, and when it's folded you're ready for more versatile usage. It's not as easy to type with two hands folded but it's doable.   The placement od the fingerprint reader is damn near flawless. I find myself using it all the time. The face reader is stupid fast but because of having to wear a mask or using different sunglasses or wearing a hoodie, it's just easier to use the finger print reader. I don't want to have to program the face reader with 5 different masks or sun glasses I like wearing. Finger print readers during the pandemic for the win (I'm looking at you apple).  Guys, check the finger print reader on the fold 3, don't sleep on it. Samsung needs to put it on all their phones (Sony has had this Design for a while). The engineering on this device, hats off Sammy.   I'm telling you right now, Samsung is definitely on to something with this design. I'm at the park right now typing on the big screen, taking a break while taking in the sun while listening to music on my buds pro.  Another big surprise I didn't realize this would have over the s21 ultra..... The radio bands and Bluetooth connectivity seem much more put together. I get much better Bluetooth on this device. It connects faster when using android auto. On paper the specs are supposed to be the same but this device seems to fly faster. Call quality is better than my calling experience with the s21 ultra. I'd be walking in the park and my s21 would cut out during calls. Not sure if Samsung used better radio bands (if someone knows about they please respond) but compared to the s21 ultra they definitely did something different whether using better codecs or they have a whole different team working on this project vs the team that works on the galaxy phones. I know they had two separate teams working on note devices and galaxy devices.  Either way I'm pretty impressed. This ui build has given me zero issues. I've had no freezes or crashes, even with the third party apps I use. Sometimes I'll have to reopen an app because it didn't format correctly on the big screen, but it's rare.  People afraid that the battery would suck, I'm telling you it's fine.  Also the camera is totally fine. I use it to take photos on the fly and don't feel like I miss my s21 ultra camera when doing so. The only thing I do miss is not being able to zoom in as easy as the s21 ultra, but that's a knit pick. The zoom on this phone is tolerable.  Yes, it's a device I'm glad I got. I returned my watch 4 classic because the ui was half baked and most of the health features were wonky and not ready for prime time. But this fold 3 is indeed ready for prime time. I'm not sitting here waiting and wishing for them to put out an update to fix xyz software issue with this fold 3.  I'm actually worried that the next update might mess up everything that's working good (usually not the case but some s21 ultra updates made it work worse for that device and had me waiting impatiently for the next security patch), but I more than likely that the next update will improve it better.  For the next version I'm hoping for a bigger screen on the front, at least a 6.4 inch screen. Definitely better ui capabilities to utilize the bigger screen RealEstate with third party apps (right now you can only do the three apps at once on the screen with Samsung apps), better camera, dust resistance to go with the water resistance. I can definitely see them making that happen with the fold 4 by how successful this phone was in terms of sales.  Its gonna be real hard giving up this form factor for the s22 ultra (I upgrade regardless because of the better processor they put in these newer phones, and using a Phone for an entire year for me is like an eternity).     Anyone else who's also enjoying their fold 3, I know you feel me on what I'm feeling with this device. Keep up the amazing work Samsung.",samsung,Fold 3 two week impressions... Tldr: homerun

RowenaOblongata,1631116485,"Years ago I owned a Samsung S4, replaced it a few years later with an S6. Was very pleased with the phones during those years (but the bar set by the competition may have been very low at the time thus making Samsung Galaxy phones seem like rock stars).  Since those two phones I've had a variety of other non-Samsung phones (all Android), most recently the OnePlus 7T. I was happy enough with that phone (it had an incredible camera) but I wanted a phone that could receive 5G, so after a long Samsung hiatus I went with the S21+ 5G.  Wow am I now regretting that purchase. There aren't enough bytes on reddit's server farm to enumerate my complaints but here are the top ones:  * BLOATWARE - O.M.G. enough of the super-helpful Bixby. Reminds me of the equally-annoying 'Clippy' back in some earlier versions of Windows/Office. Even worse than bloatware...... bloatware that puts up notifications that can't be disabled.  * Fingerprint reader works so sporadically that I don't even bother with it anymore - when I have the option to do either fingerprint or PIN I do the PIN * Face recognition is just as bad as fingerprint. I even went with the less secure setting to make face recognition less picky and it works maybe 50% of the time. 0% of the time if I have my hat on.  * Smart unlock routines - aka Bixby routines - to keep phone unlocked when I'm at home and connected to my own Wifi, or when I'm in my car connected to car's Bluetooth... again, they work some of time time but are far far from 100% working * Yesterday, phone just would not connect to mobile network. I was somewhere where I \*KNEW\* there was cellular service, and trying to use ParkMobile to pay my parking fee. Ended up having to go find a kiosk and pay with credit card. Later it occurred to me.... maybe restarting phone will help - guess what, it did. But then... I have the feature enabled to auto-restart my phone every morning at 2:00am. A few days later, and a few supposed auto-restarts later, I check the 'up time' in my settings and see that the auto-restart hasn't been working AT ALL. The phone meets all of the conditions for auto-restart, so not sure why it isn't restarting.  * The camera is far worse than the one I had in my OnePlus 7T. Yeah I know I could have splurged for the S21 Ultra and its kickass camera, but I figured the S21+ would be at least as good as my old OnePlus. Not even close. Not to mention that the stock Samsung camera app sucks just as bad as the camera resolution sucks.   If you are looking to get a really nice Android, I'd avoid the Samsung S21 line. As for me, I'm stoked about some of the reviews I've been reading about the upcoming Pixel release, so will check that out. Or maybe the latest OnePlus.

VapeScaper,1631034457,"Hi all, quick question for fellow Samsung users as I've been scouring the internet and can't seem to come up with much in the way of answers.   I currently have a Samsung S10+ which has lasted me 3 years, and technically still works fine, but it's beginning to show it's age particularly in the battery department. I work from home, and average close to 50 hours a week with 90% of that time spent on the phone. As a result, I'm thinking it may be time to upgrade.   My eyes currently are on the Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra, but there is one problem that is a massive issue for me, being that they have decided to remove the 3.5mm jack. This removes the option of using a wired headset when I need a quality microphone option for work related calls. I know that wireless options exist, but most claim to last for quite awhile then you read reviews and find that's not the case, or that that timeframe drops considerably after a few months use, etc and I absolutely can't have my microphone option dying on me constantly throughout the day. I have tried to think of ways to circumvent this issue, but I just can't come up with anything past just using the phone on speaker phone all day when I take calls which will technically work, but isn't as ideal and probably won't sound as good as my wired headset alternatives.   So for anyone who works from home, and has a Samsung phone void of the 3.5mm jack, how to do you handle your work calls or what devices have you used that have worked best for you? I don't technically have to upgrade yet, but I would like to soon and I just don't know what to do.",samsung,Working from home - What solutions have you found to the missing 3.5mm jack for phone calls?

diddone119,1630806051,"Disclaimer: This is my first EVER smart watch so I have nothing to compare this watch to. Regardless here is my first week with my new watch.    Last weekend I was looking at new phones to replace my 9 note. I stumbled across a ad for best buy featuring the watch 4. I click on the ad and looked over the various styles. I eventually settled on the Black 46mm classic, the stainless steel and routing bezel along with the 46mm sold me. It was 379 and I grabbed 2 years of geek squad discounted to $40 instead of $60. I scheduled to pick it up from a nearby best buy later that day.   I went to best buy got the watch, no issues with pickup. I told myself not to open it intil I got home but I wanted lunch and got curious while sitting at my lunch table. So I opened the box.  The package was minimal, came with a wireless charger pad, I slapped it on my wrist. It was easy to get on my left hand, it felt a tad awkward at first as I don't wear a watch, I wanted the face to sit on the side edge of my wrist not the top and the face being so big it would feel strange. I then realized I was setting the watch in the wrong place. After that it was been super comfortable and it doesn't bother me at all.   Setup was a breeze, I turned on the watch and my note 9 immediately asked if I wanted to connect via wearable. I had to do some setup on my phone took about 5 to 10 mins. After it was connected it put me through a little tour of the watch. Then set me free. I played with it through lunch, it had 68% battery out the box so I had some time with it. I set a watch face on my phone.  The interface was so so so smooth I mean wow. Seamless is the best word to use. The screen was bright and inviting, you didn't wanna stop messing with it at first. I set up my bmi and did a EKG at the table and checked it on my phone ( I wasn't dying it came back sinus rhythm.) This is a really cool feature coupled with the blood oxygen and bpm as I have heart disease. A good example was this week I got my second covid shot and my heart rate was elevated the next morning, my watch told me my heart rate was high and I went to my doctor to confirm I just had some more rare side effects and he gave me a blood pressure medication. I would have never been able to tell my heat rate was 120 . I would have know it was raised but I couldn't have counted it in my state.  Battery live is pretty good (once again first watch) I charge it at 8pm so its ready for bed at 10pm every other night and it's dead when I charge it. So thats 48 hours a charge.   All in all this watch has made my health more of a focus in my life which is always a positive thing. I haven't found a thing I don't like about it yet. My biggest recommendation would be to get the the classic. It is alot sleeker and the bezel rotation is awesome asf.",samsung,A week with the Samsung Galaxy Watch4 classic 46mm

CJoshuaV,1630794679,"I'm a long-time tech enthusiast and power user, and I'm frequently an  early  adopter. My phone is such an essential tool, however, that I held  off  on trying a Fold until the third generation because I didn't feel  like  the technology was fully mature yet. Reading the reviews of the  Fold 3  convinced me that the it was time to give the new form factor a  try, and  my impressions after the first week have borne that out.  This   post is intended for people who have a similar user profile, and are  on  the fence, or who just got their new Fold and want some tips. As  with  everything on Reddit, your mileage may vary.  **My User Profile**  My   previous phone was the Note 20 Ultra, which I loved for everything   except its curved screen. I read a lot of text, and the curved screen   messes with margins. It is also incredibly hard to protect. I *hate* curved screens, and I think they are Samsung's worst ""innovation.""  My   job requires me to work with a lot of large PDF's and image files,   reviewing complicated case files, large spreadsheets, and reading   complex academic documents. Most of the heavy lifting is done on a   laptop or a tablet, but being able to quickly annotate something on my   phone or review it there is extremely handy. I also use my phone for:   SMS/WhastsApp/Signal, Zoom, reading several news sites,   Twitter/Instagram/Reddit, Duolingo, various Weather and Travel apps,   YouTube/Music, Maps/Navigation, web browsing, and Kindle (when I'm not   using my Oasis). I'm not a heavy S-Pen user, except when annotating a   PDF. I do enjoy PC gaming, but I've never found my phone to be a great   gaming device.  **General Impressions of the Fold 3**  Like   most folks, my first impression of the Fold 3 was one of awe. It  really  does feel like the future, and it's hard to imaging going back  to a  candybar phone after using the Fold 3 for a few days. The build  quality  is outstanding. The phone feels solid without being too heavy,  and the  hinge is a masterpiece of design.  Both   screens are absolutely gorgeous. I use the front screen more than I   anticipated, and it's much better for one-handed typing than the Note   20u was. If you read a lot of text, or spend a lot of time using SMS or   similar messaging services, the front screen is great. For looking at   images (e.g. Instagram), it gives roughly the same experience as viewing   them on my Active 2 watch. It gets the job done, but that's about it.  The   main screen is a thing of beauty. Text is crisp and sharp, images have   great color depth, and it feels like glass under my fingertip. Unless I   am in bright sunlight, if I'm looking at an image or a video (or   anything that's not a solid bar of color), the crease disappears *completely*   when I'm looking at it dead-on. Otherwise, it's there, but easy to   ignore. The same with the behind-the-screen camera. If I look for it, I   can't miss it, but I usually forget about it.  The   screen doesn't just look good. All of that added real estate is just   fantastic for working with documents or images. I think the display   ratio and screen size is pretty much perfect.  Multitasking   works so well that I found myself wondering how I ever lived without   it. The ability to have my Gmail and Calendar side-by-side, or WhatsApp   and a browser, or a Word Doc and the calculator, open at the same time   is extraordinarily helpful.  Sound  is astonishingly good, for telephony, music, and gaming. Clarity is  excellent, even at high volume, and the speakers can get quite loud. The  mics are also excellent. A confirmed with a colleague that they could  not tell, at all, that I was on speakerphone.  The   cameras definitely feel like a step back, but not a huge one. I've  still  gotten some excellent photos. The shutter doesn't seem as fast as  on  the Ultra, but even low-light shots still look quite good. The   under-screen camera is more than fine for videoconferencing.  The   fingerprint reader is the fastest I have ever used. I often forget  that  it's taking the time to read my fingerprint when I unlock the  phone.  Regarding  gaming, the Fold  3 is making me rethink my hesitancy about playing on  phones. I love  strategy games and RPG's, and the Fold is perfect for  them.  Civilization 6 and Slay the Spire are must-have games, in my  opinion.  They look *amazing* and there's just the right amount of screen real estate to fully enjoy the games without compromises.  In   most positions, the Fold 3 is much more comfortable in my hand(s) than  I  expected, especially with a case on it. The one exception is when  I'm  lying on my back in bed, reading one-handed. There never seems to  be a  comfortable place to put my thumb. My Kindle wins out here,   unequivocally. Sitting upright or standing (where the weight of Fold 3   goes back into my hand instead of forward on my thumb), the form factor   of the Fold 3 is extremely comfortable - closed or open.  I've   found battery life to be excellent, but that is with some caveats.   Letting it charge to only 85% left me with battery anxiety, so I charge   to 100. In addition, I use the 60 Hz refresh rate, and I aggressively   turn off notifications and background battery usage for apps. I do this   manually, one at a time, in the Apps section of Settings. With moderate   to heavy use, I'm ending the day at 25% battery.  **My Suggestions**  Here   are the things that I have found useful to know/do. Again, your  mileage  may vary, and I'm sure someone in the comments will tell me how  wrong I  am.  The best piece of  advice I've  gotten from this subreddit was to try the Niagara launcher.  I spent a  lot of time getting it configured to my liking, and now I'm  completely  sold. I purchased the lifetime license (you have to dig for  that  option). The launcher has both left thumb (Favorites and Folders)  and  right thumb (All Apps) scrolling options, which means - if you set  up  the Favorites thoughtfully - that you can quickly access any app  with  either thumb. This is extremely helpful with the screen open, and  the  interface is identical when using the front screen. Highly  recommended.  Secondly,  setting up  the Edge panel is essential to efficient multi-tasking. I  didn't see  this talked about enough here (maybe because everyone else  already knew  it). Not only should you put the apps you intend to use for   multitasking on the panel, you can also save app layouts there. Just   tap the handle between the windows and choose the option to send a   shortcut to the Edge. This is a massive time saver.  I   spent way too much time experimenting with web browsers. I'm a big fan   of the Atlantic, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, but I   prefer just using the web to using a proprietary app. I tried Chrome,   Firefox, Brave, and the Samsung browser. Hands down, the Samsung browser   won. It looks great on both screens, and transitions naturally between   them. The ad blocking also works quite well. I just wish I could  import  my bookmarks from Firefox.  Keyboard-wise,   I know that a lot of folks like the split Samsung keyboard, but I   really didn't want to give up Gboard (where I primarily swipe type).   Thankfully, I've had zero issues with Gboard. It's extremely fast   (swiping) on the front screen. On the main screen, I either use it in   the default, massive (but still very fast) layout for dual-thumb typing,   or I use the option to shrink it to a moveable, floating keyboard that  I  swipe with one finger.  I do   recommend fiddling with the lab settings. Instagram, for instance, looks   much better if you set it for Full Screen instead of Default under   ""Customize Aspect Ratios.""  I also   found that using a light theme rather than a dark one looks better on   virtually everything because the crease seems more pronounced on a dark   theme.  Finally, cases are a pain   for this phone. It feels fragile without one, but the choices are:   either turning it into a brick with something that protects the hinge,   or leaving the hinge exposed and using adhesive to hold a multi-panel   case to the phone body. In addition, any lip raised enough to protect   the front screen is going to make swiping from the bottom a challenge. I   wish a press-and-hold on the side button could be set to take you to   Home for this reason.  I went with the [Evo Tint](  from Tech21, based on recommendations here. It seems to offer good protection, while keeping the profile *relatively* slim. I also went with the [Whitestone](    front screen protector, which I had a phone shop install for me  because  I kept getting bubbles and dust. I have the Aramid and one of  the  Spigens on order. I'd like to try the Incipio Grip too.  **Conclusion**  Setting   up a Fold 3 takes a little bit longer than a typical new phone. It's  an  entirely different form factor, and it takes some experimentation to   adapt to new ways of using a phone as both a candybar and a  mini-tablet.  It's worth taking the time to play with the new features,  especially  multi-tasking. If you don't, you'll just replicate old  habits and not  take full advantage of what the Fold 3 can do.  In   terms of hardware and design, the Fold 3 exceeded my expectations.  It's  a huge leap forward compared to a candybar phone, and I have no  regrets  about my purchase (which was heavily subsidized by coupons, old  tech  turn-ins, and the military discount).",samsung,(Long) Thoughts After Week 1 with the Z Fold 3

Well today I discovered that the flip 3 and fold 3 got this feature in one ui 3.1.1 Granted, there is no way to customize the maximum % nor there is a smart overnight charging thing, but having the option to limit the charge to 85% is still a big improvement over not having any of these features.

Liam2349,1630758360,"I don't see it talked about much, but this is a big deal, and one of the reasons I want to keep buying from Samsung.  Yeah, Apple does display replacements (at extortionate prices next to Samsung, considering that Samsung can replace the 120Hz OLED on an S21 Ultra for way less than the latest iPhone display, wtf? lol.  And the display replacement even includes a free battery. And the Samsung display has an attached EMR digitizer.  But the reason I'm making this post is that although Apple does do display and battery replacements, that's literally it.. anything else is classed as ""other"" damage and costs hundreds and hundreds of pounds.  My mum now has an iPhone 8+ with a cracked rear glass. Ok, let's see what it costs to fix, can't be that much... £399. For some rear glass. What the fuck. The phone is not even worth that much.  I asked Samsung how much the rear glass costs for Note 9 and S21 Ultra, it's £99 and £109 respectively. I would have said that's a lot for some glass, but it's way cheaper than Apple's price.  Want a rear glass replacement for your iPhone 12 Pro Max? £566.  This is the exact same reason I won't be buying from Microsoft again. I wanted a Surface battery replacement and they wanted £450. Apple is a little better, but they do not operate an actual repairs service.  If you have a problem with your Samsung device, they price out all the individual components, e.g. motherboard, sensor package, whatever else your device has, so that you are not stuck paying such exorbitant prices for ""other"" damage. This is really important to me, and to the environment - Apple's approach just creates excess waste, contrary to their claims of caring about the environment.  Oh and at least in the UK, Samsung's costs include home pick up and packaging of the device. Apple expects you to book a face to face appointment and take the device over yourself.",samsung,"Just want to big up the fact that Samsung has an actual repairs service, as opposed to Apple"

ImALeaf_OnTheWind,1630543131,"   Initial impressions:  It paired very easily between S21 Ultra and Galaxy Book Pro 360 15"". No going into settings or anything, just pressed the button and tapped the screen and the phone asked to confirm pairing.  Then I went to do the same on the GBP and it had already ""synced"" the pairing by then and was ready to use.  I kind of wish that carrying case could charge the S Pen, it's essentially just a holder. Also, that is not flat, but rounded a bit on the back - so if you try to attach it to the back of the laptop, I don't think it would stay. I wouldn't do it on a 360 anyway, because it wouldn't fold all the way around.  I like the thicker size better than the pen that came with the GBP - I just need a holster with a pocket clip so I can put it on my shirts poindexter-style. Anyone with suggestions?

PoeBoyJoe,1630518886,"   To start, I switched to a Fold 3 from and iPhone 12 pro. It's my first foldable and I mainly switched because of a great deal and I wanted to try it. I will say, I'll definitely miss my iPhone's camera. Personally and I think a lot would agree, I've had the best luck with iPhones and having a fantastic point and shoot.    However, while it will be missed I'm not one to take a ton of photos so it was something I was willing to give up. Do note, the Fold 3 still holds it's own. I wouldn't say it's as good and  iPhone definitely has the best portrait mode but the Fold 3 is still more than adequate.      The speakers on the Fold 3 and my iPhone Pro are actually pretty similar and have a similar max volume. So no complaints there. The speakers both being on the left while unfolded is a little weird at first but it's okay.   Both screens on the Fold 3 look fantastic and the 120hz is a plus.  60hz never bothered me on the iPhone however it would bug me on something like the Fold 2 where the front is 60 and the inside is 120.   I may be the odd one out but I actually use the front (candy bar) display way more than the unfolded inside display. People complain that it's narrow and cramped but I have zero issues typing on it (although I mainly use Swype) and it's nice having everything in reach. My wife has an S21 Ultra and while she likes it, I think it's too wide as I text and navigate all with one hand.     The inner display is very nice, and the crease as well as the camera are hardly noticeable unless you're actually looking for them.  I'm on the go a lot so I mainly use the unfolded display when I get the chance to sit down and want to watch YouTube.     The battery life is so-so. It'll definitely get you through the day but obviously it'll vary for the user. I don't play games on my phone so it's not something I have to worry about.   Also, the phone is obviously heavier and so I do find myself trying to be a bit more careful but I'm sure I'll get used to it.

Another thing, the past year or so I've been using the double click power button to open up my flashlight.  More useful for me than the camera.  However with the cover screen, the only way you can use it as a selfie viewfinder is if you have double click set up to open camera.  Why can't it be a widget on the front?

Lezherus,1630337009,"   Hi guys,  So, for the past 4 years I've been using a Gear S3 Frontier, but now with the move to Wear OS I finally decided to upgrade it and got a Watch 4 Classic, which arrived 3 days ago.  So far I'm loving the watch and it's a huge improvement compared to the Gear S3! However, I noticed that the pedometer accuracy is much lower in the new Watch, at least when running on a treadmill. Yesterday I ran 10km and the Watch recorded only 8.8km, and today I ran 7.5km and it recorded only 5.75km. The Gear S3 wasn't spot on, but the deviation was always just 1-3%, but in the new Watch 4 it's over 10%, which is a lot.  So I'm wondering, are you guys experiencing a similar issue?  And is there anything that can be done to improve the pedometer accuracy? Some sort of calibration or anything similar?  I'm recording my workouts using the Samsung Health app, starting a new workout, and selecting Treadmill.  Thank you very much in advance for the help!",samsung,Poor pedometer accuracy on the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic when running on a treadmill

Squizgarr,1630114749,"Got my 44mm Watch 4 gps today and opened it up around 2:30pm and set it up. The battery was sitting at 56% out of the box. I installed an update, downloaded some apps, loaded some spotify songs, and messed around with the heart monitor and body composition features. Always on display was off and brightness was set to auto.   Around 5pm, I went for a run while using the Nike app and playing spotify to my Bluetooth headphones. The battery was above 25% at this point and I figured I had enough juice to complete a 3 mile run no problem. Before I hit 1 mile, the low battery message came up and I declined to activate the battery saver, assuming I would have enough to finish. I was wrong.  A minute or two after passing 2 miles, which was around 18:40ish, my music stops playing and I look down at the watch and it's dead. I was pretty amazed that the battery had drained that quickly and I missed tracking the remaining 30% of my workout.   This is my first smart watch. Is this normal for the battery to drain so fast while using Bluetooth and GPS? I was hoping this watch would be able to last almost 2 days on a single charge, but if this behavior holds true I will be extremely disappointed.   The main reasons for purchasing the thing in the first place was to have it tracking workouts and my sleep routine. The ability to play downloaded spotify songs to my Bluetooth headphones without needing to carry my phone was an added benefit. It's going to be really annoying if I'm going to have to charge the watch overnight to start the day at 100% just to make it through a day.   Also, the watch charges extremely slow. Almost 2 hours to get the thing to 100% from zero. Faster charging would definitely be appreciated in future products, Samsung.   Anyway, that's my day 1 experience.  Hope yours is better.",samsung,Watch 4 day 1 impressions. Battery life disappointing thus far.

Jonlife,1630101157,"Tldr: congratulations Samsung, job well done. Looking forward to what the fold 4 will be bringing    Been using the fold 3 for 2 days now. This is the 512 gb matte black version. Upgraded from the s21 ultra 128gb.  Feel:   Out of the box this thing feels like the future. My s21 ultra feels like a brick phone from 1990 compared to this thing. At first the bigger screen feels daunting, but I'm easily getting used to all the extra screen RealEstate. Imagine getting a bigger car and having all that extra leg room to stretch out now vs a small compact.   Setup:  Used smart switch to transfer everything over (used a physical cable). To switch over everything it took less than 30 minutes. Smart switch gets easier with each new phone I get. I still had to put in all the info again for my third party apps but it seemed alot easier this time. The way it transferred all my calls and texts, Bluetooth stuff etc was awesome. I'm truly amazed at how good smart switch has gotten when helping people switch to newer devices.     Multi tasking:   It seems sharper/better than the s21 ultra in terms of switching between apps and how quickly it understands what I'm doing. Both phones are beasts at this but the fold 3 seems snappier.   As 7.6 inch display, it's not all there yet where I want it to be, but I see the potential. I honestly don't think they'll have the multi tasking set up the way I would imagine it until fold 4 or even fold 5. Sadly you still can't have a youtube video playing on one side while having two or three other apps open. At least for third party stuff. I don't use many Samsung apps so that doesn't matter to me. I'd like to have clash royale on one side of the screen while having a youtube video play on the other without it being a floating video. Their new labs addition in the settings seems to be a good step/start.  But so far most third party apps just take up the entire screen which is something I hope they fix sooner than later. Don't miss out on this opportunity Samsung. Make all our multi tasking fantasies come true.   Battery:  Feels the same as the s21 ultra. The battery on my s21 ultra has gotten worse in the 6 months I've had it. It will still last me an entire day but when I first got it I'd still have over 60 percent left after one day of heavy use. Now it's around 30 percent left if I don't have a charger around. I imagine the fold 3 will be in the same boat after a few months of mileage. I'm usually around a charger so these phones are never in a position to fully drain.   I play a shit ton of games like contra returns, boom Beach, hay day, pub g mobile. I also mine pi crypto on my phones and can still get by on a full day with my s21 ultra. Pub g is the only game where after 3 rounds of playing I need to monitor my battery because it will drain. No phone will last long playing pub g mobile. Contra and hay day and clash royale seem to not be as battery heavy.    Smaller screen:   I do hope the fold 4 makes it larger but in terms of being able to use it, it's not bad. Gets the job done when I don't want to or have the time to open up the large screen.    Larger screen:   it's nice, everything I imagined. Stunning, vibrant. I don't even recognize the crease. The screen feels like glass. Both screens are fast and seamless when going from one to another.    Cameras:   they work fine. Not cutting edge but the hate on reddit these cameras have been getting is exaggerated. I get that people want the best if they're paying top dollar but I if you're buying this phone it's mainly for the folding technology. They're s20 hardware and everyone loved those cameras when they came out.   The main screen 4 mega pixel camera is dog shit, pretty useless. By next year Samsung better make sure that camera is top notch because they're missing out on people who want to use this large display for zoom meetings.    Overall impressions:  Yes this tech is overkill. It's just flexing right now because the s21 ultra does everything this phone does for cheaper. But it doesn't have folding tech. My only fear is wondering if I'm never going to be able to go back to a non folding phone. I hope the s22 ultra can get me to trade this in. But it's gonna be hard not having the screen RealEstate from this phone. I may just have to have two devices at all times, which I don't need.   This fold 3 seems like the one stop shop for multi-tasking and media consumption. After using this device I don't want to get back to single screen phone. Sending my s21 ultra back to Samsung by Monday.    How I bought it:  Pre ordered from the Samsung store. Rsvp'd before the announcement and got 100 bucks where they gave us the 512 gig version for the price of the 256gig version. After pre order discounts and deals I paid around 1400.00 total (including taxes) for the fold 3 and apple watch 4 classic (Samsung is giving me 750.00 bucks for my s21 ultra).   With these deals I never pay full price. Apple doesn't do deals like this.    Haven't had time to setup the watch 4 classic, will probably do that later today.    Final summary: this phone feels like the future. Coolest technology out there hands down. Well done Samsung.  Keep up the amazing work. Looking forward to the fold 4 and all its newer specs.   Any other questions, don't hesitate to ask",samsung,Fold 3 first impressions s21 ultra comparison

Eventually my repeated insistence allowed me to  escalate my case to the Sammy tribunal, which deemed my years of Note 5 thru 20 service an OK customer, and they refunded my order* and are working directly with FedEx to get to the bottom of that missing Fold 3.  I really wanted that phone. Haven't been too excited about a new phone in a minute. But in the end, I wasted a day for FedEx nonsense and just waiting to get ""stuff,"" and now I'm getting nerd rage drunk and not sure I even I want to put anymore effort into getting this phone after all this. Samsung and FedEx are a brutal tag team that beat me down and took the techcitement right out of me.  In the end, it's just stuff. But I was pretty excited about this phone.

Daedaly,1630034183,"Hey all! I finally have decided to take the plunge and am moving to my first proper Samsung and Android after being in the Apple Ecosystem for years! I started out with the iPhone 4, 5, 6, 6+, 7 +, and then to the X, and was forced to be with Apple because my family strongly avoided Android. I did have an LG G3 for like 5 months, so I had a taste of Android for a little and loved it before my parents forcibly brought me to Apple, so it's not completely foreign territory, but I've never properly had a solid powerful Android that combats the phones I was using as a daily driver. I remember seeing the Galaxy S8 release for the first time and being mindblown by how breathtaking the screen looked in the displays in stores and being envious of students in my classes who had it when I had an iPhone 7+ at the time.   Over time, my iPhone X was deteriorating and falling apart, with a cracked front and back glass and a dying battery, and considering that Apple charges up to $549 for any repair on it, I felt that paying a ton for repairing the X wasn't completely justified for the phone with their prices even though it was one of my most favorite iPhones.   I then decided that the most logical thing to do was to upgrade it! I know it isn't the biggest upgrade, but I'm moving from a broken iPhone X to a Galaxy S10+ in Flamingo Pink, mainly because the refurbished(good for the environment too) price on them is really decent, and specs-wise, the S10+ slaughters the X. With 8GB of RAM over the X's 3GB, that is a first for me. Don't even get me started on the camera setup, that blew my mind coming from the X. Even with the feeling of seeing the S8 and being mindblown in stores on the displays when I was younger, I know I have a feeling of joy coming up with the S10+ screen that I've only seen in pictures and the magical headphone jack!  So, I will be jumping over in 4 days, as I wait for the shipping to bring the phone to my door.   Are there any tips you guys could give me moving from Apple to Android? How was the transition for some people like me migrating from Apple to Samsung/Android for the first time? What were some of your ""OMG"" moments when looking at Samsung phones?",samsung,Finally making the jump!
rickybobbybobby,1630029984,"I'm going to start this by saying I originally had the note 10 plus and after a full month of using this s21 I'm going back to my note 10 plus! And heres why.   1.)The s21 cannot handle multiview applications nearly as well. Sure the camera is a little better but the speed and ability to use multiple apps at a time is a must for me as i switch through 7 different apps daily for my job. I find myself waiting for apps to open and load a noticeable amount more than i ever did with my note 10 plus  2.) Google maps won't load in directions, it will show its ready to go but the blue line that shows you the path isn't there. My note 10 plus never had that issue  3.) Fast screen refresh rate but kills the battery in double time and doesn't make multiview or using multiple apps at a time any better.   4.) Overall the phone feels like an iPhone (like a brick)  5.) after looking at the specs the s21 is definitely a downgrade from the note 10 plus  5) The s21 has no additional storage. I added 528gig SD to my note 10 plus for $50 and i can take that out and use another if I so wish.   6.) The speed of the note 10 definitely made me not like this phone it's hard to downgrade when you're used to the upgrade although i thought i was buying the upgrade which I'm telling you now is definitely not an upgrade. I think this phone was more so they could have something to put out than a real upgrade.",samsung,Galaxy S21 vs note 10 plus review

badmisterfrosty,1629999941,"I tried pre-ordering the Verizon version of the fold 3 from Samsung yesterday,  and for whatever reason they make you log into your Verizon account and choose which line to upgrade.

I looked at my order status today and it said canceled, and I never received either an email or cancelation confirmation email.   So I talked to Samsung's online chat,  who confirmed that Verizon canceled my order be cause the line I chose wasn't compatible.  Why Verizon has a day in this I have no idea.   So I went to do a new order,  but Samsung's website still says my Samsung financing balance is low, as if I were charged for it anyway.   Samsung financing confirmed that my full credit was available and their chat support confirmed that the charge was canceled.

Finally, a fully charged watch to play with! At this point I was curious how long the battery was going to last as it took so long to charge... it estimated 10 hours.  I was so determined to like it I brushed that off, after all, I'd been fiddling with it a lot as it was my toy.  I didn't get to use the sleep function that evening as I was going out for the day the next day and watched it fully charged.  During the day, it worked well, and I started to think all would be well after all, even though I had a sinking feeling and some of the shine had been taken off my new purchase.  My new charger was there when I got home.. hurrah! But... no... after a few seconds charging it said ""charging paused"" and refused to charge.  After a bit of frantic googling I turned the watch off and charged again, this worked, but took a long time (2.5 hours).  I wondered if it was my adaptor and tried it on my fast charge official Samsung plug. It did the ""charging paused"" thing if on, and if I turned it off it showed a scary yellow exclamation mark.  I contacted Samsung customer service - live chat, who said they would transfer me, and promptly vanished. I waited half an hour before I gave up and called instead. I really struggled to make myself understood and was eventually just told, ""it doesn't come with a charger"" and no help regarding my issues.     Very sadly at this point I just asked for a return as a last resort, which I was promptly given (with no offer to help resolve at all).  It's going back on Thursday, a day before it's even released.  TLDR: Watch4 classic - looks nice, but battery is shocking.",samsung,So disappointed - my Watch4 classic is being returned before it's even released.

Samsung may need to figure out what those things are before Apple releases their own take on the flip so they can take credit on the foldables 100%  What features do you think the Z Flip still lacks?  Do you think it needs a button that would unflip the phone, like those sci-fi movie phones? LOL just an idea.  Definitely a bigger front screen with widgets, notifications, instant apps support.  Edit: I forgot about this - transitions and animations that look super eye candy and satisfying, like when you unflip the phone. Apple knows how to do this stuff.  How about the software? This is Apple's strength... Do you think Samsung has differentiated One UI enough for the Z Flip? We have the exclusive Flex Mode interface for foldables already so that's a plus. But how about the current home screen, app tray, etc design? It's exactly the same with the candy bar touchscreen interfaces. Do you think there needs to be some differentiation for those? But then again the flip just unflips to a candy bar so idk.   I'm just happy that Sammy is way ahead with everyone in the foldables, but I'm also on the lookout on what Apple would bring. They might put some brilliant stuff in their own flip and people would reinforce the narrative that ""Apple always waits before the tech has matured"" or something. What are your thoughts?

I got a Magnetic Magnetic Sticker applied it to my Baseus Wing Case (Ultra thin just 0.4mm) while being careful of the position of the Wireless Charging Coil.

Although this might not be super useful but very convinient imo and opens up many possibilities. U can use your phone while charging wireless if needed anytime without much bulk added. The Magnetic mechanism makes sure you get the perfect alignment every single time and thus you don't need to haunt constantly for finding the coil on the charger for those who do use wireless chargers. U can get a Magnetix Car Mount and use it to make your float in the car. There are many different types of magsafe stands. Not to mention the future types of accesories there could. The wireless charger is like 20$ on avg and the sticker is 3$. For 23$ you're getting an amazing sleek wireless charging setup that alone makes it 100% worth it.

Samsung is disabling them as they bow to the carriers who again are so scared to loose revenue from juicy international travelers. Proof is that after a year in the market the Galaxy are getting the eSim feature once their replacement is there i.e. The Note S20 in April 2021, The S20 and the Galaxy Fold 2 recently. This weakness from Samsung in front of the US carriers is just another factor contributing the decrease in Samsung Mobile Business.

Brokeshadow,1629482796,"So, if you didn't know, samsung has a module by the name of Theme Park for GoodLock, where you can create your own themes, it can work around with your wallpaper but you can custom create one too. I'm going to show what it does and hopefully that gives an early look at what material you on OneUI 4 might look like! So, to start off with, I have this wallpaper set (I'll attach links that has images for the themes since can't attach them directly here oof), as you can see, it is a slightly brown theme with pinks and darks, currently the module isn't the best at recognizing the colors, either that or it picks colors from a random spot in the wallpaper, hence in my trials only one of the major colors was taken to be themed after, nonetheless, it does it's job, somewhat. Ad you can see, the drop down quick toggle is completely adapted to the colour scheme. System apps seem to adapt to it too but on various degrees, like settings is completely changed to follow the theme. Some don't follow it at all while others a bit and some show a lot of adaption. Like photos show no change, clock shows some change and files is completely changed! Widgets are not affected at all.  Link colors and text in some places have changed too tho they aren't the best, often times its a dark shade over a dark colour. Keyboard has switched to follow the theme too but only the samsung keyboard.  This is very probably also where the ""leaked"" screenshot of material you on one ui 4 came from, it was probably just this.  I'll attach the link here!

I realized something today - four years ago, my home contained representations from most of Samsung's various lines of consumer products. Today, the only Samsung products I own are the SSDs in my computer, and my clothes washer/dryer.  -	I returned my QLED TV because of the forced ads and terrible support experience, replacing it with a Sony TV. -	I switched back to iPhone after experiencing the S10s terrible crapware, forced ads, and Bixby behavior. -	I got rid of my SmartThings hub and replaced it with Hubitat, because I got tired of debugging why my motorized window shades weren't closing all the way in scene mode, and why it sometimes took 20 seconds to toggle a light on after pressing a zwave button.

walleyealx,1629053139,"I've had a Note 9 since launch and I finally started getting the itch to upgrade. I had an s21 ultra ordered but cancelled it when I saw they would be releasing the new ones. Pre-ordered the fold 3 directly from Samsung with a watch 4 because of all the deals.  I read that Best Buy had the new ones to play with, so I figured it would be a good chance to handle all of them since I'd never even seen the Note 20 or S21 in person. I spent about 30 minutes going in between the phones since no one else was there.  Overall my impressions pretty much mirror what I've read and seen online:  Flip: A great looking and feeling phone that is made well....but I've never really wished my phone was smaller so it wouldn't be much more than a gimmick for me. Still tempting though because it's such a great value and they are sleek.  Fold 3: Both of the screens are great and it definitely feels nice. The camera experience seems to be about on par with my note 9, though I don't like how small the front screen is when using it. It's hard to get a true feel for it's size because of all the security tethers, but I don't think it's too bulky.  I had read about the the big inner screen not being as useful as you might think because of the aspect ratio of a lot of videos. I definitely agree with this having tested it next to the note/s21 Ultras. When watching YouTube and other widescreen videos, you really don't get that much more screen real estate for the amount of bulk that is added.   On the other hand, if you're doing something for productivity like Excel, taking notes, etc... then the fold is far and away better.  As you may expect, the camera experience on the Note / S21 ultras pretty much blows the fold / flip out of the water.    So right now I've pretty much decided that I'm going to get the next Samsung flagship when it comes out, but I'm debating on if I want to try one of these folder phones just for fun in the meantime. I'm leaning towards picking one up just because you can get such good deals right now (especially when bundling with the watch) and the trade in value of my note 9 is higher than it has been in a while.

If I had gone to the Samsung website and traded in my Note10+ (£400 for trade in). I will have to pay £1200 not inc son deal. In my situation it's cheaper and I get to keep my Note10.  Therefore, if you have an old Samsung phone which you don't use, your current contract is coming to an end, are or know a student, and don't mind paying £65 a month for a 24 months phone contract. Then go for it. If you don't have an Samsung device but everything else I said it's you then you can buy an S9 on eBay for about £100.   I can confirm they will take a phone in any condition as I called today. The reason for this is because of the chip shortages.",samsung,Ordered Fold 3 - EE Trade in £500 off

_UglyPotato_,1628735154,"I chose Flip3 since it fits my usage + the killer size, so not everyone is gonna agree. The 2 main complaints I see about the Flip3 - apart from the physical flaws of foldables - are battery life and the camera array. I’d refute them by saying this:   1. The reason for the larger outer display vs. last gen is for users to use it more than the battery burning 120Hz 6.7” inner one. To be honest, I prefer that because it helps me limit screen time. For example, on my S20 FE 5G, the moment I check emails/texts/notifications, I spend at least 30mins scrolling irrelevant social media. I don’t think I’m the only person who does this. The outer screen shows the important stuff, time, viewfinder of the rear camera, and it’s efficient enough. Although the inner display is 120Hz, it’s adaptive. Hence, the combination is going to make the phone survive until the end of day, at least for me. If you are a “mobile gamer”, not even the ROG phone is gonna suffice.  2. The camera is not a big deal. I have no problem using the main sensor to zoom to 2x, 3x even. It’s for convenient shooting, I can sharpen in post for more “phone-look”. Never will it be able to come even close to a dedicated mirrorless camera 1/3 the price (1080p30 Micro 3/4 sensor &gt; 8k24  0.8µm)  Those power users who seek a one-phone-fits-all shouldn’t even consider a foldable to begin with. Yeah, I get the idea of the Fold, but its physical flaws defeat the reliability. Get a better priced Note or S21 Ultra or an iPhone, even. And lastly, why not Fold? I think 3 times a typical phone size is not going to benefit my use. I hope this shows some people why the Flip serves a purpose. Looking forward to trade in my laggy S20 FE.",samsung,"Just pre-ordered the Flip3, and it’s (almost) perfect for me"

Cons:  The case's flap for the front display the front display, the display you'll be using the most from day to day and should be easily assessable was a bad choice.  The S Pen holder on the back of the case was bad judgement. Why would you put that in the back of the case?? It will be unstable and will render it useless, you wont be able to use it on a desk to take notes/and use it like the videos in your unpacked event. Yes you can still use it hand, but not everyone is keen to doing this. Which again, leads to a bad user experience.  Fixes and impovements:  One simple fix that could have helped a bit was to double the S Pen holder as a kickstand, this way you could still lay it on a surface and have it sit stable.  Another design of the holder, a simple stretchable strap that is big enough for the pen to fit in securely on the side of the case would have sufficed.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   TLDR: Samsung could have nailed the design of the case but made bad judgement calls, which will lead to bad user experiences.",samsung,My thoughts on the Samsung SPen case and how it could have been improved

Bostonah,1627782149," Phone broke and was forced to pickup a new one, got a Galaxy S21+ and I gotta say it's junk. I'll be returning it and garbing a Google Pixel 4a for A FRACTION (75%) of the price.   &amp;#x200B;  I don't really need the slightly better cam, battery life, etc offered with the Galaxy. The Pixel 4a is like $216 cause I got some special financing that makes it $9 / 24 months. I will say the 120hz refresh rate is nice, coming from a pixel 3a the screen also seems a bit more colorful I haven't seen the 4a in person yet. But honestly? I can't justify a more expensive T-mobile plan, AND paying more than 75% more to get a phone that feels what; 15% better?  I mainly use a computer so I don't really need that great of a phone personally.   &amp;#x200B;  I used to have an s7, and loved it. But it feels as though samsung has really gone down with their innovations.   Main takeaways  1; Why do I need to buy a charging brick, are you trying to be apple?   &amp;#x200B;  2; the finger print reader is in the dumbest spot in my opinion. My screen Procter due to this was designed to have a circular outline where the reader is. Wonderful; I always wanted a big distraction on my brand new phone, as if I cracked the screen (that's just my OCD)  &amp;#x200B;  3. Not a big fan of the UI, but I was on Android 10   &amp;#x200B;  4. for 1k I expected alot more, and it's a shame folding phones are much more; I'd shell out 1k-  1200 for a fold... maybe jut cause it's neat.   &amp;#x200B;  5.

Soufianenj,1627226916,"Hello everyone !   Well, from where do i start ? I was an Android geek back in the days, like 4-5 years ago. I’m not talking about installing modded apps, switching themes or changing ringtones, I’m talking about rooting, custom ROMs, kernels, changing Androids every 1-2 months to test them out, i used to really love Android, specially Samsung.  I had the Galaxy S4,S5,S6,S7,S7 edge,Note 4,A5 2016…etc, you get the idea, i used to love Samsung until recently (2017-2018) where i switched to iOS.  Why is that ? All my Samsung phones had issues after 6-7 months, standby drain, battery deteriorating, lags, stuttering and more. Each time people said it’s fixed with this new phone and it was always the same story and i found myself selling the device.   With iPhones i had no problems, with the iphone 6s, 7, 7 plus and now currently on an XR. Thing is recently i think that Apple is behind in both hardware and software, and some phones like the S21 Ultra are just unreal, looking at all Youtube reviews and comments on Reddit, it looks like this is easily the BEST phone right now.  So I’m wondering ? Is it time to come back to Android ? In my country we have the Exynos variant, im afraid i ll regret once again coming back and find myself with a laggy device few months later…  I love Android, but i just don’t trust it anymore after my experiences with it, so tell me Samsung users, how is your S21 Ultra or other high end galaxy phones holding up ?",samsung,Android Veteran looking to come back home.

s1lenthundr,1627139722,"I haven't seen anyone talking about this yet, and I don't know if this is a bug or something very serious and maybe even illegal, and I already waited some months and many updates since I noticed this so this doesn't seem like an ""accidental"" bug.  If you install any app/game from the Galaxy Store that is also available on the Play Store, for example the ""Your Phone Companion"" app from Microsoft on Galaxy Store, eventually the Play Store will show that that exact app has an update with no option to skip or hide it, just an ""update now"" button (even though they are on the exact same version in both stores and both are up-to-date), and even if you ignore it the Play Store will eventually automatically ""update"" it, effectively **replacing the Galaxy Store version of the app with the Play Store one**. I already noticed this with a lot of apps, this one is just an example. Also happens with a lot of games. Sometimes it takes a while to show as an ""update"" on the play store, but it eventually does.  Remember that apps on the Galaxy Store sometimes have benefits and partnerships with Samsung, and use Samsung's in-app purchases APIs that gives Samsung 30%. Apps on Google Play Store don't have anything to do with Samsung and are forced to instead use the Galaxy Store's competitor Google's own APIs for in-app purchases which gives Google 15-30% of all purchases, instead of Samsung.  **Is this even legal?** Google is literally switching Galaxy Store apps which give money to Samsung with their own versions which gives themselves money, without people or even Samsung noticing. It only happens occasionally and not with all apps, which is probably why people aren't noticing this. I feel like if Google eventually gets called out about this, they will just say ""ooooohhh soooorrry it's just a bug"" and get away with it.  The Galaxy Store doesn't do this to Google Play apps. Even if the Galaxy Store has an update for them, it says ""cannot auto-update, the app was installed from the Play Store"", which I think it's the correct and fair way to deal with apps from different sources. You need to click ""Update"" to update it manually, which gives the users choice. If the Play Store had a newer version of the app I would understand it, and even then Google should do just like Samsung and actually ask if the user wanted to update it, not do it automatically. But everytime this happened both stores had the exact same version number.  So, after many months of Samsung's firmware updates, Galaxy Store and Play Store updates and changes, this just keeps happening over and over again. I'm not saying that one store is better than the other, I'm just saying that maybe Google is silently trying to ""steal"" costumers and profits from Samsung without them noticing. We all know how Google is manipulative about apps and their Play Store.  I have an S21 Ultra fully updated, OneUI 3.1 . Also tested on my older S10, the same happens occasionally.",samsung,Play Store automatically reinstalls your apps/games with its versions even if you install them first from Galaxy Store.

What I mean by this is that the picture that looks closer to how you see things in person is objectively the best shot. The problem with these comparisons that you see on Youtube for example is that people just compare two different phone shots without showing us how the shot actually looks in person maybe using a proper DSLR.

Rakurim,1626190078,"Hey, I am here to share the story of me and (sadly) many other customers whose order got cancelled after 2.5 months. Samsung Germany cancelled all custom hinge orders that were placed between April and May as they weren't able to fulfill them. We only got the cancellation today (after 11 to 14 weeks - with almost no communication whatsoever).  The initial delivery time back in April was 4 to 6 weeks (that was 11 weeks ago for me - up to 14 weeks ago for others) - now after very bad communication they decided to cancel all orders with custom hinges.  So yea: they cancelled ALL orders and either let you decide between a bronze Galaxy Z Fold 2 (even if you wanted a black one) or a 50 euro voucher for their store.  Sadly there is HUGE miscommunication between production and Samsung Germany. So if you plan to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and they offer custom hinges: Buy the regular version instead!  **What is even more scary:**  There is also no way to dispute as **Samsung Germany claims that orders ""are not really orders""** even if you already paid the full price.  Their terms and conditions state that anything you order from Samsung only counts as an actual ""order"" when it gets delivered. They claim you got no legal grounds whatsoever about anything you order from Samsung Germany UNTIL you hold it in your hands (which is also a huge red flag in my opinion).  It basically means in Samsung's perspective: Until you receive your item your order is not valid at all. So if they deliver something late or not at all you got no legal ground whatsoever.  I still fight to refuse the cancellation of my order (DE160115005) and it looks like it really does need to end in court - even though I'd even be fine with a black phone...",samsung,Do Not Order the Galaxy Z Fold 2 (and 3!)

First, they said that no connection prompt comes when bluetooth is off which is not true. But, after sometime, they did accept that the prompt comes up even when bluetooth is off. I explained to them very specifically what the issue was, but, still, they couldn't replicate the issue during their testing. So, they replaced my Buds+ with a new one (both buds+charging cradle sans box and box contents) since mine was under warranty. I went to collect it but I found out that the issue was still there and the connection prompt was still not coming up when I open the lid of the new case. All the related options (nearby device scanning and bluetooth scanning) were turned on. They even showed me a demo where the prompt was coming up on one of the service centre devices (an S7 Edge) but not on my S20+. They suggested to get my phone checked. So, purplexed, I came back home and started a little deep dive myself.     Finally, after much troubleshooting, I found out that the location permission for the nearby device scanning app was denied on both my phones. I never turned it off, the prompt used to come up when my Buds+ was new so I suspect some Android/app update messed it up.

I didn't want to upgrade at first to keep headphone jack, iris scanner, pressure sensitive display, and notification light. But my phone will stop receiving security updates and is decreasing in battery. Verizon has an $800 off a 5g phone with trade in deal. I don't pay for my service, but would have to pay my father the remaining cost.   My 3 options are a Galaxy S21 Ultra or Galaxy note 20 ultra for same price of $400, or the S21+. Normal S21 too small. All will have a snapdragon.   The S21+ is cheapest for me. Its camera is good enough for me. It seems same height as my note 9 but a little more narrow. I like how the note 9 is a bit wider and more square. I prefer to not make my screen feel smaller by being more narrow. Missing SD card, but I don't care that much. Flat display is plus.   S21 ultra has best battery life, and good screen size since same width as note 9 but a little taller. I don't need the extra camera much. S pen is nice but not necessary. My s pen broke and I didn't even bother replacing it. But it's also heavier, but I don't know how much of a difference that will make. The main reason for it is the screen size and nice to have features. Also has better CPU compared to note. Curved display is a negative but tolerable.   Galaxy note 20 ultra has micro SD, more RAM, best screen size and shape, s pen holster, MST (though I never use it), but last gen CPU and maybe less updates. Also curved display which I don't particularly like.   Which choice is best? Is s21 ultra worth it or too heavy? Will snapdragon 888 be worth it? Is 865 good enough?

Even though the phone itself was getting very hot, this message was still present. Even when i opened the phone to look at the Wireless Charging Coil, there was absolutely no sign of any damage at all inside,.  Before we fold and go to Samsung for repairs, does anyone know a fix?   I know this is an issue with Samsung's since the Note 10 (Maybe before) but can not find much on the S21's since they are so new.     Here is what I've tried so far:     * Wiped Cache * Full reset of phone * different chargers (three in total) * Leaving the phone on charge for a few hours undisturbed * Taking back off and taking the Wireless Charging Coil off and back on to try and realign it  Thanks in advance",samsung,"Samsung S21 + ""Charging stopped, Temperature too low"""

Snapstromegon,1625339517,"I've been using a Samsung device for around a year now since my old phone broke and my GF just got a Samsung phone too and I have to say:  Every single change that Samsung makes to stock android is making it worse IMO.  It starts with that the normal android migration process from an old to a new phone doesn't work and in my girlfriends case the old phone wasn't supported by Samsung's custom migration tool, goes over to the app icon shapes no longer being customizable to pushing Bixby and bloatware everywhere.  I would be totally fine to actually pay like 5-10% more for a Samsung phone which has just a stock Android. It would make updates faster to ship, be less annoying, probably give longer updates and stopped the hassles of custom ROMs.  As a software developer I do not understand why you'd spend so much money to make everything you touch worse.  I like much of Samsung hardware especially in the cheaper sectors (low and mid range - e.g. the A70's), but the experience I had and watched now would pull me back from ever buying one of their phones again.  I'm really sad that Google no longer offers lower end Android devices themselves or promotes cheaper devices with close to stock ROMs and I think it would be a good take for Samsung to stop messing around with working and established software, breaking compatibility and slowing down the releases of security updates, just because they think they know better that the user should use their shitty browser.

It hard to tell it's not in size, because, it fit the exact size of the screen (display section, without bazel) - but it's so exact, that it's impossible to properly install. And even after doing it couple of time and finally nailed the exact placement, because the edge of the glass is exactly where the display ends, there's rainbow effect on the edges.

_AlternativeSnacks_,1624838929,"(Copied and pasted from another sub as haven’t received any comments yet)  I’m at my wits end and hope someone can help me sort this out. For certain apps, Facebook namely, notifications just aren’t working. Badge notifications work intermittently and certain items like friend requests push through, but that’s it. It’s like it’s not syncing in a timely fashion.   I have every notification setting turned on. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I have cleared the cache. I did a factory reset. Shut off any and all battery optimization and closing of background app settings that I could find, background data is allowed. Can’t find any sync settings. Nothing is working.   I admin a group but also have a work life and can’t just sit around with Facebook open all day to keep an eye on things. I rely on notifications to keep myself more productive and on my phone less.   What else could I be doing to fix this? Is this related to being logged in on another device like a tablet or PC?  I’m on a Galaxy S20+ with Android 11 and One UI 3.1. Default launcher. Everything is as “out of the box” as I could get it to be. (For clarification I mean in terms of launchers and factory resets in case any apps were causing problems. Still with the optimization off and whatnot) It sounds silly that this primarily relates to the Facebook app but it’s kinda crucial that I am able to monitor things without having to be on my phone 24/7 looking for notifications.  * * *  Adding from my original post - sounds like this has been troublesome for a lot of people, not just me.

I currently have a Series X and the Sonos Beam soundbar with two Sonos One speakers for a 5.1 system ( - .1 because no sub...yet).

I will therefore **not** be able to connect the soundbar to this port. Is it likely that I will still have to deal with this audio delay issue? If so, what are my options?

pandora_island,1624665418,"I never thought I would make this post. I've been using Galaxy phones since 2014. S5, S7, S9+, Note 10+, S20 Ultra, and currently Note 20 Ultra.   For the most part I've enjoyed the experience, never really cared about not having iMessage or FaceTime. I've always really loved having crazy unique features to show to iPhone users that would blow their minds. Wireless powershare is usually the one that shocks people the most these days.   This last year I've had a mixed experience with Samsung. I was originally waiting for the Note 21 Ultra but when that got canceled, I picked up the Note 20 U over the S21 U because I love the built in s-pen and the boxy design.   Looking at the S21U compared to the S20U, I'm worried for the direction Samsung is going in. Yes, the phone is more polished than the S20. But I really don't like that Samsung has been removing things. I use Samsung Pay literally everyday, so MST going away sucks, and I have a 512 gb SD card in my Note 20 Ultra that will be useless in the future because Samsung has dropped support for those as well. I just don't understand why they are doing this, to make the phones cheaper? Fine! Do that. But the 'Ultra' version should include everything, people buying the Ultra are ok with spending more money because we want all the features possible.  I have also found that just in my opinion, the S21U is boring. Nothing about it really excites me. The new design and overall polish is nice but there's no stand-out new feature, you know? And I know, Apple is very much like this as well, but I guess with them it's expected? Like I expect Samsung to try some new, cool thing every year because historically that's been their thing. (Foldables are cool but I don't think the market is ready yet).  This would all be fine and dandy. I planned on getting the maxed out version of the N20U and keeping it for 3+ years before upgrading to really feel a difference with my next phone. The problem is, I've been experiencing a lot of problems with my phone, and I don't really want to use it for another few years.  Overall, Note20U is great. However, I have had horrible connectivity with this phone. Usually atleast once a day I will need to restart it to get my mobile data to start working again. This is extremely ANOYING. Sometimes text messages will also come in late, like 10-20-30 minutes late, even when I have good service. This was also an issue with my S20U but I thought maybe I just had a bad phone and it'd be fixed with the Note. Apparently not. The overall performance of the phone just seems to bug out at random times, like randomly my YouTube premium background play will stop working and I'll have to deactivate then reactive my subscription to get it to work again, or sometimes my snapchats will just buffer and say ""sending"" for hours while the internet on all other apps works fine, and many other small weird issues that happen with seemingly no cause. And I've been using Samsung and Android for years, I know how to tinker in settings and find solutions, but for these there really doesn't seem to be any.  Now most recently, my phone's charging port is messed up. No clue why or how. My phone will not fast or super fast charge. All the settings are enabled. It won't even charge through any usb-c cords besides my Samsung one, which just doesn't make any sense and is so frustrating because I cannot find a solution. There is no water or visual damage to the port. This seemed to again, happen completely out of no where. I've looked around online and the only solution I can seem to find is resetting the whole phone. 😪 maybe that would fix a few of the issues I'm having.  It sucks because I do love this phone. I overlooked the sub-par battery because of everything it can do, and I was fully planning on keeping it for 3+ years. But now I don't know what to do, because like I said I don't really like the S21U and also these issues have rubbed me the wrong way.   I have heard that iPhones are known for consistency and reliability. That's what I'm craving right now. iOS could be a nice change up for me. If the next iPhone has 120 hz I just might need to make the switch. Any thoughts? 😔",samsung,Considering switching to iPhone
Alepale,1624664110,"Hey everyone.  I've got the Galaxy S20 FE 5G and ever since Android 11 my battery life has tanked.

JamessCC,1624654459,"Hello.   I have the Samsung q900t and sub woofer paired with a q60t tv.   I wanted to give the whole setup an audio test and listen to some scenes I knew would be heavy on the bass and have good surround sound.   I loaded up the Prime Video app and watched the first Star Trek film with Chris Pratt. The scene in question is where the Enterprise is just about to warp into the Romulen trap. The sound goes quiet before exiting light speed and just as they exit there’s a big boom and tons sound coming from all directional speakers.   Here lies the problem. Instead of the “big boom” and loud sounds, the soundbar sounds like it’s holding back as not to be too loud. There’s no boom at all. It sounds suppressed and dulled over. Almost as if the film has been edited and made quieter for this exact scene. Very dissatisfied and disappointing.   I loaded the exact same scene up on the YouTube app (same tv) and watched the exact same scene and all of the expected sound and surround sound was there.

finewhitelady,1624567363,"I'm stuck on which phone to upgrade my husband's OP6T to.  These are the prices we can get through Costco until Sunday (all the S21s are 128GB models only):  * S20 FE 5G: $430 * S21: $520 * S21+: $700 * S21U: $880  Prices are out the door with no trade-in, so it's a pretty decent deal.  He's budget-conscious and would prefer to spend $500 vs $1000, but the difference between FE and S21 isn't a dealbreaker.  He needs a better camera than what he has, but it doesn't need to be the best (i.e. ultra) and prefers not to spend the extra money on the Ultra and also deal with its unwieldy size.  He'll be using it mostly for dog and kid pics.  He also prefers a slightly more compact phone than what he has now, but can go similar if needed, just not a lot bigger.  He doesn't care about an SD card or headphone jack and can get by with 128GB.  Otherwise he uses his phone mostly for texting, Reddit, Youtube, web browsing, and light gaming (Hearthstone, Shadowverse, and Wizards Unite), so he doesn't need a ton of processing power.  Ruled out the Ultra due to price and size as above.  Since the S21 and S21+ are essentially the same phone in 2 sizes, he'd go for the smaller and more budget-friendly S21.  But we're stuck between that and the S20 FE.  In practical use it seems that the camera quality and battery life, probably his 2 most important criteria, are very similar.  I've seen conflicting reports about battery life though.  If the FE were substantially cheaper than the S21 I'm pretty sure that's what we'd get.  But for the &lt;$100 difference, would you spring for the S21 (getting longer update support and a more hand-friendly device) or save a little cash and get the S20 FE?

No. Now if you switch to 64megapixel mode, now you get a bit more crop than a 1x somewhere around 1.3x.

jayhuxley,1624301703,"So I had an interesting weekend. I noticed brown ""flakes"" on my clothes after washing in my 2-3 year old Samsung washing machine. I thought at first maybe some food got in the wash or maybe I had dirt in my pockets (which isn't abnormal honestly) from hiking or all the other stupid dangerous things I do. But a couple self-clean cycles later, still more. Decided it was time for action.  Took off the agitator and found the issue. A few YT videos later and I found an absolutely horrible design flaw. Just check the pictures out [here](  and [here](  The agitator is a plastic piece capped with a thin stainless steel piece. So what's between those two pieces? Scrud, lots of it.  The top piece doesn't come off easily. I had to pry it off with various tools and it was just as difficult to put it back together. Next time I have to clean it, I'm leaving the top piece off, it's only for looks as best I can tell. My hands are a bit cut up now, I'm tired, and it's just the worse.  Also, this has completely changed my mind on Samsung. Not that I think only their washing machines will have this problem. I know other brands will too. It's the fact that this design is so damn horrible. The agitator should either be a) one piece or b) at least be easy to pull apart and put back together for cleaning.  Yes, I will be cleaning the washing machine more often. But Samsung lost me as a customer (for everything) because of this shitty design.

Part of the reason I am upgrading from the A5 2017 is that the 32gb internal storage space is basically full just with Android + Essential System Apps installed. 64GB+ internal memory is therefore essential.  Previously, I went from the S3 -&gt; S5 -&gt; A5 2017. One big negative is the A5 was the glass quality - It seemed to crack very quickly despite supposedly being better than the S serious glass.

ShaneDomain,1623681503,"Hey Peeps,  Just wanted to share my experience relating to Samsung Australia's appalling warranty process.  Phone is a Note 20 ultra 5g 512 which has been kept pristine.  Device has gone in twice for warranty - first time around for soft photos in tele - verified by Samsung rep at their store. Phone went in, came out and all was good…or so I thought.  Discovered main camera lens kludged fixes by techie and now dangles off to one side and rattles as though it isn't secured.  When tracking focus is activated, the focus box sometimes shakes, sometimes moves from one side to the other, sometimes disappearing completely.  Tech's also left a blue piece of plastic I recognise as the spudger from an iFixit kit inside, which has now disappeared into the phone through a crevice.  Tiny specks of dust have also appeared between main lens element and camera glass (Aware at this sensor size and focal length there's no impact to image quality). Pretty sure water resistance at this point is out the window.  Took it back to Samsung a 2nd time, rep escalated to a ""voice of customer"" person after verifying claims I specified what the symptom, potential cause and possible fix may be… and here's where my blood starts to boil.  Voice of customer rep emails at 4pm on a Friday afternoon to pass on the tech's suggestion it could be the ""app, accessory or sim card"", tech flashes the firmware, packs it up and sends it off before I had a chance to respond.  Samsung rep at store was at least honest enough to admit tech did nothing.  Providing poor feedback via email netted zero response, agent on live chat suggested I ""should test it"".   One more try at rectifying this with Samsung before I go to ombudsman.  I work in tech, I photograph as a hobby and I know how these things work under the hood soft and hardware.  At least friends found amusement in Samsung techie's response.  I have all correspondence as evidence, have been assertive yet polite thus far. Understand customer facing roles isn't easy.  To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Have worked as a tech and with similar calibre people in the past, and this just screams incompetent &amp; IDGAF.  Am I being unreasonable in wanting the phone working as intended? Is this OTT? Any suggestions on next steps or approach? Anyone else experienced similarly poor service / technical aptitude?

miskoishere,1623670327,"Hello everyone. This post will cover my short experience using Samsung's Super Fast Charger with Galaxy S21.  It all started a month a half ago when I went to my local shop and I bought the genuine 25W charger. I got home, plugged it in to see it in action. It was faster than any other device I'd used prior. My last 2 devices were the S8 and the S10. But the ""fun"" stopped quite quickly when I plugged it in for the second time. The charger died. Straight up died. I tried charging other phones, using a different ""adapter to phone"" cables. Nothing. So then I went back to the store to get a replacement. Got one which used to work perfectly fine up until today.   My S21 was at 19% and I decided to charge it. Plugged it in, everything was fine. After coming back a few moments later I was greeted by a high pitched (screeching, if I can even call it that) noise coming straight from inside the phone. Unpleasant, ye? First thing I did was turn off both Super Fast Charging and Fast Charging in the battery settings. The noise persisted. Not to mention, the battery percentage went up by a single percent. The phone sounded like it was going to explode. I did some diagnostics and of course, the 25W charger is yet again faulty. The charger which I got with the S10 works perfectly fine. No unnerving sounds coming from the device.  I do not plan on getting a new one. I intend on using my 2 year old S10 charger in tandem with a wireless one too.

Techie97,1623608065,"This seems to happen sporadically, but ever since last night I've been having an issue where I go to plug in my phone, and, there's a sizzle and the phone says it's too hot to charge (obviously).  Originally this happened last night, and I was using an Anker Powerline cable I got from Walmart. I tried multiple bricks; an original Samsung fast charger, and a 3rd party charger. I even took the cord and plugged it in to these heavy duty surge protectors I have that have USB ports. Burned with all 3 of these.   I tried 3 different cables. The Anker, a Staples NXT cable, and a crappy off brand light up cable my gf uses. The Anker cable burned, the NXT did nothing, but strangely enough the crappy light up cable was the only one that worked, and even fast charged with the original Samsung brick.  I tried using isopropyl alcohol and sprayed some in my charge port, scraped it with a toothpick, and blow dried it with a hair dryer on max heat/fan.  Same results as I described. I woke up this morning, figured I'd try the Anker cable again, and now there's no issue. BUT now I'm in the car typing this message, and a crappy 3rd party cable with a Magnavox Qualcomm Quick Charge certified car charger just caused the port to burn some more and there was visible smoke and noticeable odor when I pulled out the cable. Last week this cable and car charger were fine and caused no issues. Any reason why things seem to be picking and choosing when they work all of a sudden? And what may be happening with my phone/chargers/charge cords?  Anyone else have a similar issue perhaps and would be willing to tell me what the cause might be?  I look forward to your input, everyone. I use my phone for work so I really need to figure out what the issue is and how to rectify it. I'm a full time delivery driver for multiple apps. Hopefully I don't need to take it for repair. But if I do, does anyone know how good ubreakifix is? I'm worried about water resistance. I understand they are certified but I wonder if they can maintain water resistance.  Thanks in advance!",samsung,S10e Charge Port Burns and Smokes

I'm just curious if anybody else with a 60 Hz computer monitor is in this same boat?

I recently noticed that there is no option to toggle your camera resolution like there was before. Now this sis more frustrating when you are trying to send videos. I don't want all my videos to be freaking 4k, they take too much space and it's a pain in the neck to send these videos. Literally 30 minutes for a 1 minute video. Also most of the apps where you send these videos don't even support 4k. Whatsapp being one of them. I send a 30 second video and it gets fucking hyperlapse and compressed to shit because it can't handle it. This is one of the most backwards design they have made yet. Essentially they are choosing how fast our SD cards get filled so then you have to go out and buy more of them.

wallofchaos,1623415764,So. Samsung over that last few years has completely dropped the ball. I'm so over their cheaply made phones now. My s9 was a joke. The S10 was ok. The s20 ok. But the slapped us in the face with the early release of the s21 and ditched the s20. So s20 accessories are harder to find. (ie) cases mainly. Yes there are plenty out there but find a red case for an s20. Theres ONE. And it's silicone that rips super easy. The curved screen is also I feature I can't stand. I was somewhat in a pickle when buying a phone in the first place.   I'm afraid that if my sceen breaks or something. There won't be parts to fix it.   I had to buy it through my internet provider. Since that's the only place that would sell me a phone on a payment plan.   I'm disabled so saving 2 grand is impossible.   My question is in the title. What phone has similar specs. And OS. But it's a better phone with maybe no curves screen?   I can't seem to settle on a devide for my next upgrade. I'm changing my provider when I'm done with this s20.   I was thinking a pixel.

So, I went ahead and bought a regular sized Galaxy S21, assuming that was all taken care of. Then a couple days later I got another email saying that the phone was unsent and the package would be returned to me without a refund.   This is, obviously, blatantly false.

Great!  A couple days after that, they followed up with me to let me know that the original determination was correct and I was ineligible to be refunded.

Last September, my father-in-law told my wife and I how excited he was about a new TV he ordered. It was a Samsung TV that amazed him in a Best Buy showroom. He was as pumped as can be to watch sports (his favorite thing) on it.  Shortly after ordering it, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He bravely fought it, but in January, it took his life. The TV was delivered and sat boxed in his basement in a box during that time, for obvious reasons.  Before he passed away, he gave us the TV. Obviously, this wasn't some precious family heirloom, but it does make it more than ""just a TV"" for us.  Flash forward to now. We finally got around to fully clearing out his house, and took the TV home. When we set it up, we discovered that somewhere *inside* the paneling, there is some sort of crack, and the screen doesn't work. Again, no external damage.  I called Samsung and explained the situation, they sent out a service tech who told me that the warranty won't cover this because it's physical damage.  I followed up with Samsung and explained that if some sort of damage happened in shipping, no one would have known, because it wasn't opened. They said, and I quote, ""that was something the original purchaser should have followed up on immediately."" I told them that they couldn't because they were literally dying of cancer, and the response I got was basically ""Sorry, I understand that but we're not going to do anything about it.""  I'm not sure how much the panel replacement would cost Samsung, maybe a few hundred dollars? Whatever it is, they've decided that in this situation, it's not worth their while to fix the TV.

RetroGamrGirl,1623160340,"This S21U is my first Samsung phone. I opted to go with it over Pixel this gen because, well, the Pixel 5 is a tiny slow mid tier disappointment of a phone.   However I didn't really do a lot of research before buying I just saw some articles claiming it's the best Android phone so far of 2021, has a giant 6.8"" screen, and would be perfect with Google Stadia.  Little did I know Samsung phones are an ecosystem within an ecosystem which is kind of bizarre. They have their own ""Samsung Account,"" ad tracking, preinstalled apps galore, Android skin, and even their own app store for some reason. I'm honestly very confused as to why any of this is necessary.   I decided to go in head first. I made a Samsung account, used ALL their branded apps, Bixby, and even the Galaxy Buds Live. I figured if I'm going Samsung I might as well try the full experience.  Ultimately I was extremely underwhelmed. The apps felt amateurish and clunky. The UI design boring with uninspired flat black backgrounds and simple text. Stale and devoid of any playfulness you'd find in Google's offerings. On top of it they inject ads into random stock apps like Weather? Why? Why is this necessary? Bizarre. The only time I remember seeing an ad in Google's apps was Google Pay I believe, and I'm pretty sure you had to opt in to partnerships.  I'll be honest... I investigated being able to return the phone to GoogleFi but I was just a couple days outside the return window. I ended up adb uninstalling almost all of the Samsung bloatware, running ruthless launcher, and using hex_ theme tools to hijack Samsung Theme engine and install a Pixel skin. Now I downloaded all Google apps down to the flipping calculator. The app design is light-years ahead of Samsung.  I really really tried to like Samsung's little mini ecosystem, but it felt unnecessary. Like they were trying to lock me in to *specifically* using Galaxy devices down the road, and Google apps don't do this to you as you can use them on all Android devices. Why would anyone want to be further restricted in choice when the biggest pro of being an Android user **IS** choice?",samsung,Galaxy users- do you prefer Samsung or Google apps?

dragonatorul,1623154049,"Hello,  I have a Samsung A70 phone which was working flawlessly until the update before last. I waited one update in hopes that it's a bug they'll fix, but now I'm betting it's planned obsolescence.   Before anyone says it's all in my head I have quantifiable examples. I use MoonReader+ with epub files and the TTS feature which reads it out to me using google TTS British female voice. I can leave it running in the background while doing other things. Prior to the update this would be seamless and I could go about loading other apps and using other apps without any impact on the TTS. After the update starting other apps takes noticeably longer, longer than 1 second, and it interrupts the TTS while the app is not responding. It's as if they added a system-wide halt condition when starting any app for the first time.   This wasn't a case of it becoming slower over time, it was literally in the 15 or 30 minutes it took to update. Before the update it was running perfectly, without any sort of slowness that I could notice in the over a year I've been using it, then this happened. I was in the middle of listening to a book when I got the update notification, ran the update, then started the book back up and noticed that the apps were taking a long time to boot and were freezing the TTS while they were booting. At first I thought it was because of the reboot or stuff still happening in the background but days later, and multiple reboots later, it was still happening.   The subsequent update seems to have reduced the time it takes to start apps, but the slowness is still there. I am not the only one reporting this problem. Two other friends using Samsung devices have had the same problem, one with an A50 and I forget what the other has. The friend with an A50 upgraded to an A52 (I think) because of this issue, so it seems to have worked in at least one case.

I have had iPad in the past and they were awesome and I had decided that the SE was perfect for my needs.   Eventually though I saw some cheaper Android phones that seemed really nice surface for far better prices- the Oneplus Nord N10, Blu V91, and Samsung A32. It was important that I could by them up at the local bestbuy without ordering them there (because I have no ID to do in-stode pickup, can't have my parents see it in the mail, and I can just easily ride my bike up there and buy it).. so that led me to settle on the Samsung A32 as it was available there.

TastyBananaPeppers,1622769868,"These are my first impressions:  * **No Samsung Mod guide.** This is the #1 problem because you can't assume that everyone knows what to do when they accept the mod invite. This is a big community with a lot of mods. You'll have a high turnover because the new mods don't do anything or they do their own thing that causes issues. * **No communication prior to the mod invite.** I think you made the mistake of maybe sending invites to people without directly messaging them first to get to know them better. You got lucky with me because I have modding experience and currently have a well-managed subreddit r/PoGoAndroidSpoofing Even though I know what to do, I still have some doubts because there's no guidance here. You also should have had a vetting process because some people don't own a computer. The mod tools on a computer is better than on a phone or tablet. The mobile app is limited, and you can easily mess things up if you press the wrong icon and won't know you mess things up. Some people just want to be a mod because they assume they get special features, but in reality, they don't. Some people think they're going to get paid for it. * **Rules aren't being enforced because they aren't clear.** Some of the rules are making people scratch their heads. These rules should be rewritten and  requires collaboration with multiple mods before finalizing them. To be honest, I don't know what self-promotion is. I can google it, but I still don't know what it is and how my post would break that rule. As for tech support, does that include posts about asking to fix something. This is why a mod guide would also help explain a lot of stuff. Everyone has a different interpretation of the rules. * **The Wiki is okay, but I consider it to be useless.** It's hidden on the mobile app. No one will see it unless they go looking for it or is told by someone to go check it out and how to find it. Formatting the wiki is a pain in the ass, and you can't really make it look good. The wiki can easily become a wall of text for TL;DR (Too Long;Didn't Read). Your other, better alternative in to create individual posts and have sub-menu links. * **How do you define mod activeness?** You already have 8 mods. I have strange feeling that they aren't active at all, so you added a bunch of new mods to the team. * **You need to have a separate communication chat for mods.** This would be for mods only where we can talk about stuff and dispute issues together, so everyone is all on the same page on how we're going to deal with issues.

TwentyfootAngels,1622676322,"I'm 99% sure the answer is no, but I have to try.  Many months ago I got my new A20 and was a little disappointed in the screen resolution, but it was a free phone and I decided to hang on to it. Well, today my iPhone SE from 6 years ago finally kicked the bucket and stopped accepting the SIM card. I have important phone calls that could be coming in the next few days and had no time to wait, so I decided to just put the old card in my A20. I've been using my A20 for things like games and a backup for my 2-factor authenticator, and over a few months I had it perfectly set up in a way I enjoyed. So I turned off both phones, put the, popped in my SIM card from my iPhone, and turned them both back on.  My A20 loaded up normally for a few seconds, but before I could put in my swipe code, it crashed. It was stuck on the ""SAMSUNG"" screen and I had to hard reset it to make it go back to setup. It very briefly flashed a blue ""ERASING"" screen with the Android logo and I immediately knew something was wrong. Then when it loaded up, it was showing the first time setup ""Let's Go!"" screens and asking me to choose a language. I couldn't find any way to go back, so I clicked English and got a message saying ""an unauthorized attempt at resetting this phone to factory settings was made, enter your passcode to continue"". And since it accepted my passcode, I thought everything was fine, and went throguh setup because I checked online and couldn't find any way to go forward without this. Since it told me I needed to go online to verify my identity, I thought that maybe it would be okay.  I finally finished it all and *everything* is gone! All of my apps, settings, accounts, and even my 2FA apps. I'm lucky I didn't have any photos on there. Thankfully my old phone still turns on, but it's hanging on by a thread and could die any day now. I'm quickly transferring over my two-factor settings before my old phone dies but this is NOT what I wanted. The phone was set up and I've been using it for months! I never wanted it to factory reset and I have no idea why putting in a SIM card would do that, there was absolutely no warning.  So... here's the question, do I have any chance at all at getting my old phone back? Right now I'm backing up my 2-factor codes but is there any way I can undo this or find a backup? If there's anything that can be done, I'd really appreciate it.  **TL;DR: Old iphone died, put the SIM card into my Galaxy A20 that I've been using for months. It crashed and factory reset itself without warning. Do I have any chance at undoing this?**",samsung,Galaxy A20 factory reset without my consent when I put a SIM card in it from my old phone.

I like the phone itself, the big screen is good and everything else is just OK and gets the job done fine, but recently I have been having issues with it. It started just before Christmas of 2020 when the phone, working as normal that day, refused to charge with any lead or plug. I sent the phone away as it was still under warranty and the battery and changing port were replaced by Samsung and the phone appeared to be working as intended once again, only now, barely 6 months after the initial repair, the phone is having the same changing issue as before. Amazingly, the phone is still under warranty and I will be sending it back for another repair in the next week or so, but I was just wondering wether recurring issues like this were common to many Samsung devices, to the A70, or just bad luck?

I've tried many different things to fix it and this is only on wire, I have found one single normal wire that does charge the phone although the rest of the wires and bricks I have tried (multiple from different companies even Samsung) all don't work.

After a week in their possession, they claimed to have fixed it by wiping the phone and putting the most current version of the OS and security updates.  Welp, today the phone up and does the EXACT SAME thing.   Now, instead of writing it off as a bad phone and replacing it they want me to send it back again for them to look at which is completely unacceptable.  I told that to a supervisor who advised me the only other option would be to go to a link he provided me for the ""Service to Sales"" program, where I could basically upgrade my phone and trade this one in.  However, the link he provided is no different than what I would find if I browsed to it myself, and there is no reference I can find to a ""Service to Sales"" program (so Ive been lied to once).  Further, I would not be able to do a trade in for the value of the phone because it does not boot up to the home screen (so Ive been lied to twice).

xMeaMaximaCulpa,1622519703," I have been a Huawei user for 6 years  now, got the P10 and the P30. Samsungs have left a bad taste in my  mouth for a few years due to how bad it was in terms of longevity back  then and how it would slow down after updates.  Things  changed recently, I got my hands on a Galaxy S10e to replace my Huawei  P10 as my work mobile. I was stunned with how snappy it was, how the  good the camera was, the One UI was one of the things that attracted me.  It was simple and minimal compared to Huawei's EMUI.  I've  been wanting to move away from Huawei for a long-time now due to the  privacy implications of using Huawei devices and with my experience with  the S10e, Samsungs are now back in my list of possible candidates.  Right now, I am looking into the S10/S10+, Note 9, Note 10, and maybe the S20 line up if I would find a secondhand unit that would fit my budget.   However, one of the things that I am still reconsidering is the Camera quality. I really enjoy using the Huawei camera and the quality of their photos is superb. Is there a Samsung phone that could get close to the quality of the P30 photos or even beat it? Based from my experience with the Galaxy S10e, the camera is pretty good, but I haven't really tested it for photography, just for regular photo taking for my work that's why quality doesn't matter to much for me, but for personal photos it is a big factor.

I don’t really use iMessage much honestly I mainly reach out to people on WhatsApp and snapchat. And my most used app is YouTube and safari. I don’t know what other details are important but I’m willing to share if you have any questions.  So overall do you think it’s worth taking a leap of faith and trying out a galaxy instead,samsung,Should I make the switch?

In the (roughly) 60 notifications I've received from Digital Wellbeing, all but one or two have been positive growth in the 30 hour range.

I'm new to the Samsung ecosystem and I'd like to hear other peoples' thoughts on whether this is common with Samsung phones or if other people have had issues like this.   I've had my S21 ultra since the end of April, and the battery life has been great that whole time. Sometimes I'd forget to charge my phone at night and it still be going strong the next morning. But about 6-7 days ago, I suddenly noticed my battery draining incredibly quickly with seemingly no explanation. Looking back, I think that's around the time I installed the last update, but I'm not certain. I didn't install any apps/live wallpapers/widgets or change any power/optimization/background settings. I work in tech, develop mobile apps, and have been using native Android for 12+ years. I know what to look for for battery drain, and I can't find anything to cause this.

No charging during the day.  And here's today so far:   For people who don't feel like clicking, it's a very steep curve, and the phone is around 65% after just 2-3 hours since full charge.

No one really knows exactly what it does. While I don't know for sure what it does in its entirety, there is one thing I found out that it does. Specifically on my phone, whenever I turn on and off enhanced processing and go to CPUZ, for me, specifically CPU cores four, five and six, idle at higher clock speeds and when under load, sustain those clock speeds for longer. And even when doing small tasks, The phone is more willing to boost higher speeds. While enhance processing may do other things, supposedly it increases your CPU's clock speed. This could explain why some people get lower scores on synthetic benchmarks because the phone is boosting to a higher clock speed for longer it's more likely to throttle near the end of the test lowering its overall score.

Since then, there have been many changes to the phone UI and android.   Does anyone know of a way to turn wifi on and off automatically.  I want to turn wifi off when I leave the house, here is my reasoning.  I have deployed a large number of IoT devices in my home and while on local network connectivity on wifi, commands via google voice work like a charm (with some hickups here and there).

However, when I'm leaving home, for example:  backing out of my driveway to go to work and I tell google to close my garage, there is an incredible lag - I understand that the system may be going through the switch from ""wifi"" to ""4g""!  However the lag is unbelievably bad in that I don't know if my garage is closed unless I actually sit there and see them close.  The lag is about 45 seconds and then about another 30 seconds for my notification to send me the ""All Closed"".    On the other hand, when I disconnect wifi as I'm leaving going to get in my car and I issue the command, bingo, two seconds via 4G my garage doors closes and I get my notification immediately after (miliseconds).  I've also noticed this lag when just asking google a simple question after driving off and about 3 blocks or so away.  The negotiation between wifi to mobile is really bad or it's just the phone not knowing what to do and timing out on wifi after leaving.  Any ideas on this would be helpful.  BTW - the flair requirement is extremely limited and only goes to Note 5.",samsung,Automatically turn wifi on and off

Ecstatic-Brush-3787,1622085831,"My parents got me a pair of the Red Galaxy Buds Live for Christmas last year. They're my first set of wireless earbuds, and the battery life is absolutely incredible but I have a lot of problems with them that I feel outweigh their convenience.   1. The Fit. Probably the worst thing about the buds is that they don't fit in my ears at all. After months of use, I have figured out a way to put them in my ear and make them stay there, but I experience a lot of pain while they are in and even after I take them out. I shouldn't feel relieved when taking the earbuds out.  2. The Shape. The shape of the earbuds is honestly so ugly to me. It looks like I stuck cherry flavored jelly beans in my ear. I like the fact that the buds are inconspicuous, but why the jelly bean type shape? It's so weird.  3. The Touches. Any hand movements close to my ear will trigger the touches and often messes up whatever I am listening to. My biggest issue is when I listen to a podcast on YouTube, and my hand triggers the touches and switches to a completely different video and I have to find my spot in the previous video. As a girl with long hair, it is especially annoying when I have the buds in with wet hair, as this will also trigger the touches. However, about a quarter of the time that I actually want to use the touches, it doesn't work. I actually really like the feature as I like to leave my phone in a different room and still listen to the buds, so it's nice to just touch my ear and turn music/sound off, however it's like my touch doesn't register and I end up having to take the entire bud out.  4. The Grips. The grips did not stay on, and I have lost both sets of them. They did not help me at all and now the bud isn't as aesthetically pleasing now that they've all been lost. I did nothing to lose them, they stayed on at all times and I only recently discovered that they have fallen off.  5. The Case. I love the magnets holding the buds in the case, however when I accidentally knock the case over, the buds ALWAYS scatter across the floor and I have to the use the Find My Buds feature on the Wear app. The design of the case does not allow for a case to be used, unlike Apples Airpods. I would love a silicone case, but Samsung doesn't sell any that I can find.  6. The Dirt. The buds are incredibly difficult to clean and I do not like how much dirt and wax that accumulates in the small spaces.  7. Calls. I walk everywhere, and I often make a lot of phone calls to my LD boyfriend. I like to talk while I walk, but apparently he cannot hear a word I am saying (inside or outside) while using the headphones. I do not like having to hold my phone up while I walk as my arm tends to get super tired so this was a huge inconvenience to me. I also discovered that if you disconnect the buds while making a call, the touches will still engage and end the call when you touch the back. I have done this so many freaking times and hung up on so many people just because I was trying to take the buds out of my ear since the quality is so bad. I've just decided that the convenience of the touches does not outweight the inconveniences that come with it, so I have decided to block touches.   8. Left Bud Issues. I often have problems with the left earbud and it doesn't connect even though it was charging in a fully charged case. I usually just put the earbud back and charge for five minutes and then it works but it's a big disappointment.   I'm curious to hear others input on my issue with the buds. Does anyone prefer them to the other kinds? Should I upgrade?",samsung,Galaxy Buds Live Rant

pexx421,1621879351,"So, I have a Samsung lcd smart tv. The irritation here is this. I use my Bluetooth mk402bt Dayton speakers rather than the tv speakers. First, let me interject 2 things. The speakers on this tv are absolutely marvelous as tv speakers go.  Seriously, compared to the 8 other TVs in this house, all the rest the speakers are pretty much like listening to your cell phone, but this Samsung tv has pretty damn good speaks. That aside, I’m a speaker head, and for anything other than casual background noise, I want real mids, lows and highs. So the second interjection, shout out to parts express, who’s Dayton audio mk402bt is the best powered speakers, bt or otherwise, in the $80 range. Their bass and mids are extremely unexpected and satisfying in such a small cheap package. Seriously, I want to buy a set of these for all my friends and family. Does it compete with my real set in my living room entertainment system? Not close. But for my pretty large (20x20 with 15’ ceilings) bedroom, they sound phenom.   Problem is, when using Bluetooth speakers on this tv, the Samsung keeps a flashing mute icon on the left side. It’s fine for watching music, but completely ruins immersion in movies.

I was given another apology and told ofcourse, after another half hr, I was told a case number has been generated and please be patient, we are connecting you to management tier support....like a fool, I waited,  and waited...finally got the ""support team leader"" who tried to tell me she had never heard of Global Goals Campaign...suggested I was hacked and needed to transfer me back to an agent who could get into my phone....

SundayRed,1621496379,"I'm a recent Samsung convert, moving over from Apple after 10 years. I bought the A52 (5G) and the Buds Plus headphones but have had nothing but problems with these devices interacting with one another.      The Buds pair with the phone easily. You know they are paired, because it plays the 'chime' sound and on-screen, the phone literally tells me they are paired (and when I max the volume, I also hear the sound, so the Buds are clearly working).      When I go to an app however, **no audio is audible**.      I have tested this on Spotify, YouTube, MLB, The Athletic and others, so it's clearly a Samsung problem and not an isolated issue with an app.      **The ""progress bar"" on the song/video moves along seamlessly, but there is no audio coming out of the Buds**.      At this point, I restart the phone, reload the app and the audio works perfectly.      I don't know what happens before this point, but something is causing a massive problem between the handset's ability to stream audio through the Buds. Obviously this is an unacceptable inconvenience to restart my phone every time I want to listen to something, but it's especially shit at night because I go to bed listening to podcasts and the restart process of the device includes:      a) Screen defaults to max brightness   b) Vibration haptic on start-up that would wake the dead   c) Needless button presses      I cannot tell you how much this is frustrating me and I have no idea what to do.      Is it a Buds problem? Is it an A52 problem? Is it an Android software problem? As mentioned, I'm convinced it's not the apps, because it's the same terrible experience across any app that plays audio.

In our case the phone behave normally when the camera is not in use.  Short story long:  My  partner was in a need of a new phone, that she would also use for her  work, which mainly consist of making online course for which she needed a good camera. After a lot of thinking and review, her choice naturally went to the S21 Ultra (Exynos version here) which seemed to have a very good camera.     We received the  first unit just in time for the filming of her next online course. She started filming and went in front of the camera where she talked for about 1.30 hours. Once finished she went back to the phone to notice that **not only it was burning hot, but that the camera application shutdown due to the high cellphone temperature**.   **Only 10 minutes out of the 1.30 hours was recorded**, you can imagine the frustration.   The camera settings were nothing impressive, the recording was done in FHD with automatic frame rate, which is the default.     After this happened I started testing the phone. I updated to the latest firmware (G998BXXU2AUC8 then G998BXXU3AUDA), and would test the raw base firmware without installing any application. The results were catastrophics :   **- Filming with FHD 30 FPS would last between 10 minutes and 1.20 hour.**   **- Filming in UHD 60 FPS would not last more than about 10-15 minutes.**     The speed with which the issue would reproduce mainly depend on the temperature (we live in Thailand, average now is 30C), but the experience was also fully reproducible in air-conditioned environment. In comparison, and under the same environments settings, my Oneplus 7 would record flawlessly without any issue.     My  partner really liked the phone and it's capability thought, and we believed it could be an hardware defect, so we exchanged the phone for another unit.   It was the same.   In the end, **we experimented with 3 DIFFERENT UNITS, all of them exhibiting the exact same behavior**.  I would have loved to make the same tests on the Snapdragon version of the device, but the only vendor I could find who sell them here won't issue a refund in case of problem, so it is a no go. But if you use the Snapdragon version of this device, I would love to hear from you.  Now not only this is a shame to see such a defect in a flagship of this price which primary selling point is the camera, but the inability of Samsung to acknowledge the problem also raise a questions when forums are plagued with report concerning this issue.  Questions :  \- Do people with the Snapdragon version of this phone are able to not reproduce this issue (And if yes, could you post how you tested: room temperature, video settings, length of the video) ?   \- Almost none of the phone review we've seen mention this camera overheating problem which is fairly trivial to reproduce.

svooo,1620407140,"Hi all,  As the title suggests I am thinking to update my ageing Note 9. Initially, I was considering A52 or A72 (mostly A72 for a better camera?!), as both meet my basic requirements. (typically I use my phone as a phone, browse the web, read ebooks, play some games (mostly chess, or instant games in Game Launcher, so not really graphic intensive stuff)).  So, for my needs, both should be fine. However, currently, there is a promotion on S21, hence I can get Galaxy buds Pro for free with it.   Where I am located, I can get S21 at around 720$ (and buds Pro cost around 170$), whereas A52 and A72 I can get at around, 330 and 380 $ respectively.   So added value of Buds Pro makes me really consider S21 (looks something like 550% for S21 vs 380$ for A72), especially I think I'll get much better resale value for S21 than for A series. Also, S21, supports Dex that I use from time to time with my Note 9, which is an added plus and the screen size is more suitable to me (A72 is on the bigger side).  So, as I have not used Samsung Phones past Note 9, I curious whether extra bucks worth S21 or it would be better to stick with A72/52?   How the battery life would compare with A72 vs S21. I know it is 5000mh vs 4000mh, but maybe there is software optimization, screen size, etc would have a say.  Logic dictates I should take one of A72/52, but S21 with Buds Pro is very tempting, hence I need your opinions, suggestions.  Cheers",samsung,"Upgrade from Note 9, S21 or A72?"

cjam84,1620292407,"This is a bit of a vent, but also a genuine discussion point given how isolating my experiences have been with Samsung NZ. Who knows, maybe someone from Samsung will read this and something will happen...  Backstory: I ordered an S21 Ultra from the Samsung NZ webstore on Sunday 1st May. OK its been less than a week and I'm being a little impatient, but the simple act of wanting to check order status has highlighted several failings of the Samsung NZ webstore process.  1 - Order tracking currently doesn't work. The ways it's not worked have varied, from the tracking page not loading, to it loading but the order number lookup button doesn't work.  2 - online chat options are all geared towards tech support. There's no chat option for ordering/sales support.  3 - similarly, the Samsung nz number have a multitude of options for product support, but none for sales support.  4 - the email address for the webstore has no autoresponder to confirm receipt of emails. Sounds trivial, but when you've been trying to get in touch with someone by various methods, it'd be nice to know the email has been received and will be dealt with soon.  5 - the ""escalate"" email the ceo option... Doesn't work. You can fill all the details in, click send, and you get an error message.  6 -on top of this, the options presented to you on the Web store support pages vary depending on whether you are on a desktop or mobile device. It's not very consistent.   The whole experience of trying to ask a simple question and then trying to provide feedback has been an exercise in frustration, and has felt quite amateur to be honest. I did not expect such a multitude of hurdles from such a massive international company.  I'm curious if anyone else has had similar issues. I have no doubt that actual product tech support might be quite good given how helpful the tech support people have been in trying to help get my message to the web store, but they've not been able to go the whole way and provide an answer on their behalf.",samsung,Surprised by lacking sales support by Samsung NZ

I always thought that maybe, it's the shitty Samsung camera software. I mean, the A71 isn't a flagship after all...  Out of boredom today, I decided to play with my Camera settings, tried turning off Super Steady and I was shocked with the results. Video quality is SO MUCH BETTER NOW. Crystal clear and no more grainy footage. Apparently, turning on Super Steady means you won't be using the 64MP main cam in video recording. I'm today years old when I first discovered this lol I'm such a dumbass sorry!  Don't go with 0.5x zoom too if you want the highest video quality bec it doesn't use the 64MP main cam. Go with 1.0x.",samsung,Just discovered that Super Steady is the reason on why my videos look BAD... (A71)

Unbeatable23,1620058693,"Pre-ordered the new S21 Ultra and have been very happy with it. However, randomly what looked like 3 little specs of dust under the LCD appeared. So I called Samsung tech support, explained the situation and he very casual tells me it's a warranty claim and to send it in. Before I went to the UPS store, I took 3 picutres of the phone showing the damage, just for my own records and in case something went wrong. After this, I went to the UPS store, watched them pack it with lots of bubble wrap and extra packaging in the box and sent it off.  About 1 week later I get an email saying my repair cost for my ticket has changed, it's actually out of warranty and that in order to proceed with the repair I have to pay $323. Immediately I call Samsung and they try telling me that it's out of warranty due to scratches on the LCD. I've only had this phone a couple months and I knew there was no scratches on it, so this was wrong.   After they transfer me to multiple different departments, I finally end up talking to the case management team. He makes me upload my pictures (along with a screenshot of the digital fingerprint to prove when they were taken) via txt to attach to my ticket#. After being put on hold, he comes back and says he can reverse the charges and they will fix it for free due to the pictures I provided.  Unfortunately, he opened another ticket because they now have to do an ""investigation"" with UPS and determine what happened. He said depending on the outcome of this investigation, it will determine if I get to keep my warranty or not after the repair.  Here's the pics for reference:     tl;dr: Take lots of pics of your phone before sending it in for a warranty claim.",samsung,Take a lot of pictures of your phone before sending it in for warranty.

That said, I bought a TV at the end of 2018 and I bought a Samsung TV and paid about 700$ brand new. Fast-forward to today and a large area in the middle of the screen has turned dark, probably due to a LCD light failure. That is a major defect in just over 2 years of regular usage. I don't have the TV on 24/7 like some people do and the TV has not moved from its initial spot, ever.  So I called CS, I don't expect much here since everything it outsourced now. I had the typical hard to understand customer service and managed to get a resolution after a few calls. They first refused to repair my TV for free because it was out of warranty. Lucky for me, there is a law where I live that forces manufacturers to cover warranty for a reasonable amount of time for a product. Typically for TVs, that means a few years depending the price. When I mentioned that, they offered to cover the price of labor but not for parts, I promptly reminded them of the law and a couple of calls later, they finally caved in and offered to repair the TV for free out of kindness and this was a one time thing. They only caved in when I said I would have to open a complaint with the local court and potentially bring them to court.  The whole point of this rant is that Samsung, you disappointed me. TVs are not smartphones, you cannot expect us to replace them every 2 years or so. Freaking wooden box TVs last over 20 years.

badasafish,1619898489,Hi all. I currently have an S8 and I use this to create gameplay videos for YouTube. I achieve this by sharing the screen to my PC using Scrcpy and the audio is captured via a 3.5mm connected from the phone to the line-in on the PC. This solution works perfectly.     I am wanting to upgrade to the S21 but I've just noticed that it doesn't come with a headphone jack which means the above solution won't work for me. I googled and saw that you can get a dongle to get a 3.5mm jack but I also need to be able to connect the phone to the PC via USB to transmit the video data.  I also saw that you can get split dongles to give you a USB port and a 3.5mm jack but from what I can see the USB port offered is just for charging not for data transfer.     Does anyone have any solutions that will work with the S21 and allow me to mirror both the screen and audio to my PC in high quality and low latency so I can capture it.

Until_Morning,1619659358,"I just got off the phone with a Samsung customer representative who basically told me that there is 110% nothing that I can do to gain access to my Samsung account. She told me that the CEO of Samsung himself would not be able to help me, and that my situation is absolutely impossible to solve.   The two-step verification requires me to either verify with the phone number associated with my account, which I no longer have access to (I changed my number because I was being harassed by a stalker), or with a backup number that is a RANDOMLY GENERATED 8-digit number that I could not POSSIBLY remember. I mean, if I set up the 8 digits myself I would remember. It would be something simple like my birth date. But nope, it'sa bunch of random numbers that can only be accessed by logging into the account...which I can't do because of two-step verification.  SO, the other option was to change the phone number associated with my account by providing the IMEI of any Samsung phone my account has ever been linked to...which according to their records is a Samsung J3. I have NEVER owned a Samsung J3. I probably signed into one for like a day or something, trying to do something, but even then I never owned a Samsung phone with an actual data plan or anything, nor do I even remember or have access to the Samsung J3 as it was two years ago.  So apparently there's nothing that they can do or that I can do to remove two-step verification so that I can access my account.   It was super considerate that they give you the option to change the number associated with your account, in case you no longer have access to the previous number...but then they require a previous IMEI, under the assumption you still access to that sort of stuff.  I could make a new account, but I NEED this account because it has a backup from a Samsung S10+ I owned for a month back in 2020 (I actually sold that phone to afford this one, and had to wait until recently to buy this one I have now). And no, for some reason the S10+ isn't listed as a previous phone associated with my account, even though I had to sign in to my Samsung account on the S10+ to back up the data or do anything else related to my Samsung account like save passwords. And that sucks because I could probably contact the person I sold it to (through OfferUp) and get the IMEI from them.   So basically Samsung trapped me in an impossible situation, so...thanks a lot.

Samsung offers a 5% discount anytime you use a referral code. This is only valid on your first order, so make sure to make a new account for your purchase! Here's an active referral code to use: ref-9iqhcq   Discount programs. Samsung offeres various discounts (usually 7% off) just for being a student, veteran, etc. All groups receive the same discount and most don't verify your status so it's not a lot of extra work to checkout. Just make sure to select your discount program you qualify for when on the landing page!                           you can message support that you want to cancel your order. Often Samsung will offer you a 10% discount if you keep your order! Obviously YMMV, but the key is to be nice and to message support AFTER you get shipping confirmation from Samsung. Here's an example dialogue of what the conversation looks like:     Cash back through Rakuten. You can get cash back (it varies daily, but often up to 10% cash back) by simply shopping through Rakuten.

jkiss12,1619459247,"I've always liked samsung products, I've had 4 galaxy phones that served me well but in the last year samsung has caused me some next-level headaches.   Part 1)   At the end of last summer, I bought some galaxy buds+ and found that they beeped in direct sunlight - now a known issue. I talked to customer service and at the time it was not recognized as an actual feature of the product so they said send them in. I received a replacement pair that had terrible bluetooth connection issues - much worse than the sunlight beeping issue, so I had to send those in also. This time however, FedEx lost the package. I thought as I was the owner that I would claim the package and after some weeks of confusion, FedEx contacted me to let know that samsung would have to claim it because they paid for the shipping to their service center. This was at the beginning of November. I contacted Samsung many times until I was finally put through to executive customer relations and spoke with someone who said they would file my claim. Then I waited a couple months. I figured the Christmas season this year was brutal so they were likely dealing with lots of issues. So I call again in mid January, the person I talk to in executive customer relations says that the person who is working on my case would have been very busy over Christmas and will be working on my case. I check in about once a month and am told ""we are very sorry, the person working on your case will contact in the next day or two"". side note - Everyone working the customer service is very friendly and helpful BUT waiting on hold for the executive customer relations is 10x worse than the standard customer service hold. It takes way longer and instead of the cool mystical airy flute track you have to listen to this like 15 second loop of a daft punk ripoff that doesn't finish a satisfying loop, just cuts off. It feels like its designed to annoy you and make you hang up. BUT I PERSIST and last month I make it clear that I am frustrated. So now the person on customer relations says they are starting my case? It seems like the case was never started at all. They send me an email and I have sent them all the related documents. This is at least a bit more promising but I still have nothing to show for it. If this had been a phone, I would have had to replace the phone MONTHS ago and be out hundreds of dollars. If I could have taken care of the FedEx claim, I could have handled this within a week.   Part 2)  We got a samsung fridge (r18m6213SR/AA) at the end of last summer. Its worked fine - it keeps our food chilled/frozen, easy. The fridge beeps when the door is left open - fine, that's helpful. Yesterday, it started beeping with the doors fully shut and the fridge light won't turn on. The fridge and freezer are both functional but there seems to be some sort of wiring issue that this beeping is indicating. BUT YOU CAN""T TURN THE FUCKING BEEPING OFF. About every 30 seconds, it loudly beeps for about 10 seconds. INSANE! The local service repair people have me booked for May 4th, so we have to live with this fucking BEEPING for more than a week. We live in a small apartment and I work from home so I of course will inevitably end up insane. I've put a bunch of towels on top of the fridge to muffle the beep, but its still audible in every room in our place. This is a BRUTAL design that is literally causing a reduction in our quality of life and is causing me headaches.   I am disappointed because I always liked their phones but will be going elsewhere for my next. I'm also in charge of a field lab and was about to purchase galaxy active tabs to use for field data collection but am also reconsidering this as a result of these VERY frustrating experiences.   **tl;dr 1.

bantar_,1619277401,"New S21 with a Tocol glass screen protector and Unicorn Beetle case.    I had some starting pains with the fingerprint scanner.  I may have tame it, but too soon to tell.  This is what I've noticed.  Day 1:  Screen protector is on before I turned it on.   Transferred data, then registered 4 fingerprints.  Used it all day and night with nary a blip on fingerprint success.  Day 2:  Woke up and not a single fingerprint would work.   Went into fingerprints and tested and tested.  Seemed like all of my fingerprints were forgotten.   Even tried to register a new fingerprint, but it wouldn't read the fingerprint at all.  Around noon, I had time to try again, and I was able to register a new fingerprint and the others were working, but not great.  Turned on Sensitivity enhancement.   Reprogrammed 2 of the 4 fingerprints.   Rest of day, fingerprints worked great.  Day 3:  Woke up and not a single fingerprint would work.  Note, sits on Qi charger overnight.   The phone is room temperature which is about 70F.   Left it alone and was going to check it later in the day.  It started working just fine after a few hours (maybe it warmed up).  Decided I will reprogram all fingerprints first thing the next morning as an experiment.  The rest of the day, the fingerprints all worked great.  Day 4:  Woke up and fingerprints worked.  Didn't expect this.  The room temperature today was a bit warmer than yesterday, but just barely.   I immediately reprogrammed all fingerprints.    Didn't use phone for a few hours.

minilandl,1619129242,So I recently picked up an S10 + and just like I do with all my devices I installed twrp and my rom of choice.   It's blazing fast fluid and perfect it's like if the pixel had better hardware as it's running identical software for the most part. It's a real shane there isn't an Android one galaxy phone though as stock Android on samsung hardware is only available if you flash roms.   I've always found the idea of stock Android on samsung hardware interesting and something I've wanted to try for ages.  I've always been critical of samsung phones due to bloat but with stock Android the s10 plus is the perfect phone .   Also this is the first time I've owned a flagship and is a significant upgrade compared to my redmi note 5 I was using previously. As for bugs basically everything works aside from Samsung specific software features   but there's a few more involved steps to get twrp installed and magisk working .  Thank you to ivan meler and all the developers on xda for your amazing work because without it I wouldn't have bought this phone.   ,samsung,Stock Android on the S10 plus is amazing

Sharpevil,1618724322,"Since my current phone has begun acting up earlier than expected, I've decided to combine my plans to buy both a nice camera and a newer phone this year, and just get a really nice camera phone. I'm currently between the Galaxy Note20 Ultra and the Galaxy S21 Ultra.  The S21 Ultra has a lot of features that make it really attractive over the Note20 Ultra, but the lack of expandable storage is a major sticking point. Taking 4k video while traveling is an important use-case for me, and that can eat through storage fast. 128gb is only a few hours of footage, and can easily shrink to less than a single hour after crowding the phone with data and apps. I get by with a 4gb monthly plan through Mint, so uploading and deleting as I go would be impractical.  So, TL;DR: Are there any reasonable offline storage solutions through USB-C? Maybe an external hard drive that doesn't require a PC to act as intermediary?",samsung,Offline Video Storage Solution for S21 Ultra?

It will acknowledge the phone's existence and even prompt me to open the phone's file system to access the DCIM and the media files etc,  but when you go to access the phone, it promptly disconnects.

curiocritters,1618692980,"So, am due for a (forced) upgrade owing to my Nokia 9 PureView becoming near unusable, thanks to unoptimised updates (coupled with a poor design to boot) making the device near unusable (device frequently heats up, and camera application freezes upon launch, belying the whole purpose of a 'camera phone').     I have shortlisted the following devices as my next daily - the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, the Vivo X60 Pro, and the LG Wing.     I am a wildlife biologist, and my primary use case is clicking pictures of tiny organisms (insects, wildflowers etc.) when out and about, for science communication posts on social media.     I bought my Nokia 9 PureView primarily for the great Zeiss branded camera system (co-developed with Light Media, which has since exited the smartphone industry), and although very testy, the device did not disappoint me in terms of being able to **accurately focus on tiny subjects at close ranges, and capturing crisp, detailed images**.     I would ideally like something on par with my existing (but soon to be retired) device, in terms of camera performance.     The Zeiss partnership with Vivo got my attention, and their 'gimbal' based stabilization system is admittedly very cool, and I would think, would lend itself spectacularly when taking macros of flowers and bugs. However, that device lacks certain niceties I have become accustomed to, including official dust and water protection, and wireless charging.     The LG Wing is another great device, with good cameras, which, owing to LG's exit from their smartphone business, can be purchased greatly marked down. And even if LG does not honor their update commitments, it would still be money well spent.     However, from my research, I have seen, and read great things about the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. And barring the missing proximity sensor (which is appropriated for by a 'virtual' proximity sensor, and shouldn't be that big a deal, functionality wise, presumably), it seems to have everything else am seeking from a potential upgrade.     Those of you who own the S20 FE 5G, how is the device working out for you? How is the camera? Any outstanding issues I should be aware of, as a potential buyer? Does the missing, hardware based proximity sensor, replaced by a virtual solution, cause any major problems when taking calls?     How about that display? Any issues with unresponsiveness, or touch lag?     Would deeply appreciate feedback from those who own the device.",samsung,Considering a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G.

RadioactiveCancerCel,1617867906,"So, I just woke up aftter my samsung phone had an update during the night, and I don't really like it. So, let's list what I find bad and maybe you xould help me find out how to change it:  •The centered watch on the lock screen  It is not that bad honestly, but it seems weird. Maybe it is just because I am not used to it, but I'll see about that.  •Those bars that show the ibcrease/decrease of volume (idk how it's called)  I am not sure about this, it seems a little nicer because it doesn't cover such a huge area at the top of my screen. The only problem I have with that is that it seems like they just copied Apple products.  •The widget's boxes  This is actually something awful. Why would they make them look like that? They are ugly. The boxes are too round and don't ""combine"" so smoothly (I am not a native speaker and I don't really know how to describe it, but you probably know what I'm talking about). And their inside is even worse. It looks like a 5th grader, built every single portion separatelly in Microsoft Word and just put them together. There is no ""continuity"", the font used is ugly.  •The menu nackground is blured  I don't really have a problem with that, it was just a change I had noticed. It was nice to see the background wven when I opened it but it is also useful, so I don't blame it.  • Notifications  When you get one while using the phone, it looks exactly like an iphone. It is better, but again, it is a copycat.  •The media and devices buttons when you glide down on the screen (again, I don't know hiw you call that area)  Look, I don't use SmartThings and I didn't listen to music yet, so I don't know how much easier it will be. What I know is that the placement is unconvenient for me and it feels like it has nothing to do with the other things over there. Just like the widget's boxes, they don't come together well with what's around them.  And I might find even more things, I didn't explore this too much yet.

Abootgaming,1617827625,I have a Samsung TV quite new ill add the details if needed...  I'm trying to understand how hdmi or specific video inputs/outputs work...   TV connections: 2xHDMI 1 optical and some USB thing I dunno  My story...   I made a little entertainment system with a used PC I got off craigslist I put ubuntu on it and works great! However the connections are driving me crazy since I dont even know what to search for what my issue is!     The back of this PC has a 25 pin (db25 i think...) and a Display port   perfect! Ill just get a display to hdmi so audio will come through the tv (or so I thought...)   I get no signal at all on the hdmi source I select....    However the pc came with that 25pin thing to hdmi and it works like a charm just no audio which is really what I want!     So on an old laptop I did the same thing installed ubuntu    however my laptop has hdmi out so it worked just perfect (I dont want to use this laptop)   The laptop also has VGA out so I used vga to hdmi and the same thing no signal on the tv...     I guess vga to hdmi not working makes a bit of sense to me but display to hdmi I feel would work.. it works perfect on PC monitors.     Any theories or answers would be appreciated!

Decox653,1617679498,"   So bit of a long one but I'll try to keep things in order. A few new developments since my last post that got taken down.  Jan 23: Huge promo deal for the s21 250 for preordering the s21 and 300 for ordering the fold 2, I bought the fold 2 to boost my credit score and pay with Samsung finance.  Mar 3rd: Order delivered past promised date, was told I'd get a 100$ discount for 1. being as late as the order was 2. student discount not being applied on purchase. I could not apply this however until the order was complete. I start paying off the phone online.  Mar 10thish: I don't remember exactly when but a few days after getting my fold it went on sale at best buy, after matching everything they said I would be unable to apply it until the whole order was delivered and ""complete""  Mar 22nd: I start getting emails about payment not being authorized, I call in and everyone says it's fine no reason to worry. I even confirmed with Samsung's billing department nothing was off.  Mar 30th: ALL my accessories purchased with the 300$ promo credit is canceled, I call in and nobody can tell me why. I suspect it was due to the 60 day email I confirmed 10 times to quadruple check and make sure it didn't get canceled. They say this isn't the case and there was an issue with billing. What billing? Billing for free items? They can't find anything and say that I can reorder the items and they'll just refund the money on arrival. Obviously I don't trust anyone over there in the chat department as I never got anyone that spoke English, eventually I get passed around to someone that offers the 300 on a promo code which works perfect. I ask for the $100 discount as well since the order is finally complete and I don't want to wait too long and get the promo canceled.  April 4th: I get a promo code for $150 when asking about where the rest went I got this.   "" As I checked the details, it shows we have already processed the $100 save the sale refund and $150 promo code to the order""   On top of this the fold is now 200$ off, I ask if I could get a price match at least and apparently it's not allowed as it's out of the return period. So they can't alter the order until it's complete but since the order was canceled so long after I got screwed both ways. (Kind of a whatever thing but was worth a shot)  April 5th: New email from Samsung.   "" We are happy to inform you that you've saved maximum discounts on this order already . We really appreciate your time and understanding regarding this . ""   I am now waiting for an email back after providing them with proof of the promo and that it even existed even though it shows it discounted the items on my order to 0.00 and shows they were discounted.  So now I've just about given up on getting the promo back since every time I try to talk to someone I get some random person that doesn't understand English. If anyone has any ideas I'd be more then willing to try it. If you all want proof I am more then willing to spend 30 min editing my personal info out of chats and screenshots.

JohnsonHawk,1617651450,"So I went from an S7 to an S21 in the past week and today discovered my wireless headphone volume control buttons no longer change the phones media volume directly the way they used to. On the old phone if you had the screen on and used the volume up or down buttons you would see the volume bar change, as if you were using the buttons on the side of the phone directly to do it. That's no longer the case - now it seems like the buttons just gradually change the volume rather than giving you a full tick. So say for example I put my phone at a ""7"" with the buttons on the phone, my wireless headset buttons now can give me a quieter 7 or a louder 7 but wont change it to a 6 or an 8.     This is entirely worthless and not helpful.   &amp;#x200B;  As far as I can tell it comes down to the Bixby app Samsung added to phones with the S8 so I never had to deal with it before. Sometimes, rarely, if I just spam the volume up button it gives a bixby related notification and google results have also led me to this conclusion. However after changing every setting I could find and following guides to do your best to disable Bixby, it still has not given me back the normal S7 style usage of the volume control buttons on my headset.

apetrolhead,1617538736,"Hey Guys, first post here,   I've always preferred android (specifically Samsung) devices over iphones, I've had a few iphones over the years but always ended up coming back to android.  I'm now looking for a new phone (made the mistake of buying a Huawei, wouldn't reccomend) and I'm thinking about the S10+/Note (and moving onto the S21U/Note) , I've never used ear pods, smart watch, tablet etc. However I also need a laptop, will be doing alot of photo/video editing, Changing careers to Digital marketing so will be spending alot of time on it, Having briefly used mac os in the past I did prefer it to windows, No windows laptops are standing out to me so I think a macbook pro would be ideal.   Researching the Samsung/Apple ecosystem for the first time recently led me down a rabbit hole of comparing both, I never understood why Apples was so popular when Samsung phones are clearly better but trying to look at it objectively I understand it now, The general consensus seems to be everything works better together, The ease of use between all products and the fact that if someone already has a apple product it's alot easier, Let alone a huge portion of people don't actually care about the specifications and just want what's easy or what other people have, also of course the high level of fanboys.   After spending countless hours researching I still think Samsung is a no brainer. There's just no comparison to an iphone from every single aspect, The phone is the most important part as I'll be taking a huge amount of pictures/videos and for me the Samsung is the leader by a long shot, The Samsung watch in my opinion looks amazing, The tablet/earbuds seem really good, My plan is to pretty much buy the phone, ear buds, watch and tablet at near enough the same time (will be buying used so any recommendations for the best versions?) , Having never used any before I honestly wish I done this sooner, The products themselves all seem to have brilliant reviews and part of me thinks all the reviews of people saying they ""don't work well together"" are a bit exaggerated to justify using Apple.   However my question is does anyone else use the Samsung ecosystem with a macbook? Would it make life alot easier to try and find a windows laptop or is it very doable? Is there any products in the Samsung ecosystem (watches/tablets) to avoid? Is it as laggy as people say or do they all work together very easily?   Any advise is greatly appreciated.",samsung,"Strongly considering jumping into the Samsung ecosystem, Advise."

After some extensive testing with a variety of dongles that have built in DACs such as the Realtek ALC4042 and others, I've encountered a range of issues with them on the Galaxy S20 and later, whereby the gain through the dongle and volume in headphones spikes randomly causing **dangerous ear-damaging hissing and crackling sounds at over 105dB.** I have tried several ""hi-res"" dongles on Amazon and replaced them appropriately to double check, I have cleaned out the USB-C port, and even tried it on a spare S20, same issues.  I have not encountered this issue with the Google or Apple USB-C dongles, but the Apple one, as you know, does not receive adequate voltage on Android thereby having low gain (or volume) with standard headphones with lower impedance. The Google one delivers subpar audio quality.  However, so far, I've noticed adequate performance (both gain and quality) out of the Samsung dongle, which seems to be the consensus. But it seems the software and drivers on Samsung phones regulate voltage better with them and overall deliver safe and quality listening, which is not the case with other dongles from my testing.

sarelon,1617292398,I have always liked my Samsung products.  I have a laptop made by Samsung that has been a great little unit.  I even bought a Samsung refrigerator/freezer just over a year ago because they assured me they had fixed the ice maker issues and it has run relatively well.  Then in November I made a huge mistake and bought a Samsung dishwasher.  I bought it at Lowes about 40 miles away and had it delivered.  In the beginning of February it displayed an error code - the main water inlet valve had apparently failed and it was leaking into the tray around the valve.  I contacted Samsung to get it warrantied.  They told me that a repair shop would be contacting me within 4 business days.  I didn't hear anything for 10 days so I messaged them again.  Apparently the repair shop had refused the order.  Samsung said they would  send a secondary repair shop and I would again be contacted in 4 business days to schedule.  10 days went by and again nothing.  I contacted Samsung again and they said they were going to just get me a store credit and to wait 5 business days.  I called Samsung again today and finally got an RMA number.  Now they want me to take the dishwasher I had delivered back to Lowes to get store credit.  I told them if they send me the part I would fix it myself - they refused.  I used the dishwasher for 2 months and it's been sitting dead for just as long waiting on Samsung to do their job.

I'm going abroad to Korea and want to avoid having to buy a contract to get a region locked phone that (according to my boyfriend living there) is usually more expensive.  2. The S9+ will be running out of security updates eventually. After watching them pull the s20 off their site (the one I was considering due to its less amount of nerfed features and smaller size) I am afraid they'll pull the better options I'm considering to force subpar new flagship down our throats like they did with the s21 line.  As for my S9+, I will not trade it in and hold onto it just in case I hate the new phones. Worst case I can ROM it or something.

kostya8,1617148775,"While on the surface this may only seem relevant to Russian users, I believe it has strong implications for anyone living under authoritarian rule, which is a pretty large percentage of the global population these days. On April 1, a new law takes effect in Russia, forcing device manufacturers to pre-install a number of government-approved Russian apps on every device sold. The latest Samsung firmware update comes with these **unremovable** apps ([link in Russian](  This is highly concerning for a few reasons.   1. The law specifies that the apps are to be installed on all devices **sold** after April 1 2021, so existing devices are technically exempt 2. Samsung began forcing these apps before the law even takes effect 3. For me, the most damning point - Apple has recently reached an agreement with the Russian government, also caving in to their demands. **But**, in the iPhone's case, the user is prompted to install these apps during setup. You can opt out and not install them at all, or delete them after the fact. And it only concerns new devices, not existing ones. Samsung is effectively forcing all existing users to install them without any choice, even though they didn't technically have to do this  As a Samsung user, to say that I'm disappointed is saying nothing. I use Android primarily for its customizability and the level of control it gives me. The fact that even Apple's implementation is much less intrusive is honestly infuriating.  If Samsung is so trigger-happy to not only appease dictatorships, but go above and beyond, it can be a real security concern for millions of people.

I got my s21 ultra last week and only ran into one problem so far: Microsoft business apps were not allowing me to sign in. I kept getting generic error messages in Skype for business, teams, and outlook. Everything else was working perfectly (bank, reddit, pandora, etc) so I knew it had to be something with Microsoft.  I tried two steps, not sure which one resolved it so I guess just do both: I logged into outlook using my browser and was able to sign in without any issue. Next, I signed in to regular Skype (not the for business one) and it gave me the whole ""unusual sign in activity detected, please verify device"" with a code to my email. Once I did that, I was able to log in to all the apps I was originally having trouble with.  Hope this helps if you're experiencing the same issue.",samsung,Samsung s21 ultra Microsoft app issues

serose04,1617025317,"Just hear me out. It doesn't really make sense to me, that what is supposed to be the current best phone in Galaxy A series (A72) should have been actually worse in specs than second best phone in A series (A52 5G). Taking in the account that last generation A71 have 5G version I think it's very likely A72 will get 5G version too. My guess is, Samsung originally planned on releasing 5G version along the LTE version, like they did with A52, but decided to postpone 5G release because of the CPU shortages.  Now I've read some reviews and it was mention in one of them, that A72 back coved has quite a lot of will. Apparently you can squeeze it in the middle to the point where you feel that the back cover touched the battery. The article mentions about 0.5 mm of space between cover and battery. Now this could just be a design flaw, but I don't think that's what it is.

I had not previously installed any kind of backup, like Titanium Backup, and obviously doing so now would have required a device wipe, thereby defeating the purpose in the first place.  Seemed like my only option was to draw things off on an external SD card/drive. However I discovered Samsung SmartSwitch, which I had never used before, which allegedly allows you to create an entire backup of the device that can be restored/emulated on a new one somewhere. Supposedly this preserves all of the app data.  But how much of this data is actually saved? I am worried about a few apps, that have encrypted data. Specifically:  1) A messenger that uses E2EE. The keys are generated directly on the device, obviously, and I am hoping to be able to recover some of those so I can recover my old conversations for about the last year.

VanWinkle87,1616896944,"I recently upgraded my iPad Pro 10.5"" to a Galaxy Tab S7+. I really really like it. It's a genuinely great tablet, with incredible build quality, screen, and speakers. It's very fast and pretty much just as smooth and responsive as the iPad Pro. For the things I usually use it for (comics, video watching, web browsing, multitasking, and light drawing), it's an upgrade from the iPad Pro (mostly).  That being said, there are several areas that are a downgrade that Samsung themselves could have made better.  1.) I love Samsung Internet Browser on the phone, and it's the smoothest Android browser, so I want to use it on the Tab. However, it's not a desktop class browser, and I simply don't understand why. I have about 7-10 pages I generally visit, and, of those, two refuse to display the desktop site (USA Today and YouTube). That's unacceptable to me. I could use Chrome, but it doesn't have extensions, and it stutters more. Samsung could easily improve this, but I worry they won't since they've been making tablets for practically as long as Apple has now.  2.) Some common things are not tablet-optimized, like Settings, and it just doesn't make any sense to me. There's no reason not to have a tabbed view for settings.  3.) Samsung used a subpar display coating. It's much more reflective than their flagship phones or the iPad Air/Pro. The screen is not as black as it should be in average lighting or brighter. Watching in a bright room, the iPad screen looks better, and it's not even because it's brighter, but because it's got a better coating.  4.) Samsung should pay whatever necessary to bring Procreate, Lumafusion, and Affinity Photo/Designer to Samsung tablets. Those are the primary apps that creators see as making the iPad superior to Android tablets. Could go a long way.  5.) The keyboard cover is mediocre and overpriced. Should have literally been $100 at the absolute most. The back stand part is solid, but the keyboard section is super light and flimsy feeling. It's unbelievable that a $200+ keyboard cover feels this flimsy and doesn't even have backlit keys. It's nearly impossible to use it in your lap with how there's no rigidity to its connection to the tablet.  I want to reiterate that I love this tablet, but it's so frustratingly close to iPad Pro level (not to mention the things it does better). I hope Samsung will fix some of these issues in software updates and the next tablet they make.",samsung,It's frustrating how close the Tab S7+ is to perfection.

denisbence,1615995122,"After S21 was available in my country, Slovenia, it also came with promotion of free Samsung Buds, if you bought it in that initial first month or so. I got my phone about 2 weeks later, happens, no problem about that. But now two weeks later again, one month after previous promotion, there is an offer to get free Watch Active 2.  And this really hurts my feeling.   I understand that Samsung rewards costumers that buy devices first or tries to get new costumers to get Samsung device, or whatever reason it is.  But after promotion is over, it should be over.  Now 2+ months later, while people that got it after the ones that got it first, were not rewarded with anything, but some 3rd group of people gets a free watch that is 250-300€. Don't get me wrong, I am happy for them, I just do not see it fair how people in that one month gap did not get anything.  If they wanted to feed us with free stuff, sure, they could make longer promotion time and a choice of which gadget you want to take, or simply have one promotion after another.  But that gap between promotions is nonsense.  **I called Samsung's representatives in my country and I was just told, in not so friendly tone, that ""They can tell Samsung my situation, that there are many cases like that, but Samsung never cares about that. You either bought it in the promotion time or not"". And I am not  talking about buying after promo is over, I am talking about buying stuff before promo. At least I could get some discount for being a loyal Samsung user with multiple devices for years. The heck, after buying multiple of their devices I could even get a gift by default.**  In my opinion, making a gap between promotions and then give a way a 250€+ gadget can only mean that their commercial team is completely incapable of doing their job, without any basic planing how will that affect loyal costumers, or simply not caring. Or that they simple do not sell their S21 devices like they planned to and they have to fish for new costumers with giving stuff for free and make loyal costumers unhappy that did not get anything even after they bought stuff more or less fast after release. You offer free stuff on the start or on the end to sell out what is left in stock. You just do not do stuff like that randomly.

Wasteak,1615886449,"Hello there,   I've been using the S21 Ultra for 1 month and a half right now and I wanted to share my experience so far with this phone.  To add some context, before this S21 ultra, I had a Oppo Find X for 2 years. My S21 Ultra is an Exynos one.  **TL;DR :** *(order is meaningless)*  * **Pros**    * Overall Design    * Performances    * Audio    * Battery life    * Screen    * Cameras * **Cons**    * Camera bump    * Nova launcher  &amp;#x200B;  **Design :**  Design is an essential criteria for me, I don't put cases on my phones so I don't want to have an ugly one, no matter how well it performs. At first, when leaks came out I fount it quite ugly, but the more I saw it the more I was enjoying it.  It feels really prenium and materials looks better than glossy glass we had for years on samsung flagships and, at the same time, don't get dirty when you touch it.  The one downside of this design is the camera bump. It looks nice, but it's not the best thing to use. My phone is most of the time on my desk and even if it doesn't wiggle every time you're using it like this (thanks to its weight), it can still be an issue sometimes. It also makes the vibration way louder depending on which surface it's placed.  &amp;#x200B;  **Performances :**  I mostly use my phone for watching videos, social medias, few games (mosty small games and nds/gba emulators), or work.  No lag, it's very responsive, quick, etc... But anyway, I never saw any lag on my phones since at least 5 or 6 years ago I thinK. So don't look at antutu benchmark when you're buying a phone nowadays, it doesn't mean anything.  &amp;#x200B;  **Audio :**  The sound coming out of the phone speakers is great.  &amp;#x200B;  **Battery life :**  According to my phone, it has the screen on around 5h a day. 4G/5G is always turned on. I don't have any issue doing the day with the phone without charging it, I always have between 30-50% left.  Last week I had a 5h30 drive, my phone had the screen on all the time with 4g on, google maps, twitch in the background and sending the sound in bluetooth to the car. At the end of the drive, the phone was at 40%. This seem really great (for my uses at least).  &amp;#x200B;  **Screen :**  The screen looks amazing.  &amp;#x200B;  **Cameras :**  I don't take many pics or videos but they all look great.  &amp;#x200B;  **Nova launcher :**  One other cons of this phone is its firmware, when you come back to homescreen while using nova launcher, you wont be able to interact with anything during 0.1s (or somethinglike this). It's an issue that happens on 2.5+ One UI and also on other phones. It's not a killer thing, it's so quick you won't alway noticed it, but it's not the best, at all.  &amp;#x200B;  So far this phone is amazing to use.",samsung,S21 Ultra after 1 month ½

-badwithwords-,1615732411,"This post is primarily about Samsung's mobile &amp; accessory support (ex Samsung Buds+). I am basing this off of my experience with Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung.  Have called and chatted every company listed above, it's extremely obvious that Samsung isn't willing to invest in customer support and when you need support, using Samsung's support options feel like you are using a an ancient system that hasn't been updated since the dawn of time.  When I call or chat with Apple, Microsoft, and Google, I don't need to wonder if the person on the other end of my conversation actually understands what I'm saying. I'm not put on hold over and over and over again after asking (what I consider to be) normal/ordinary questions about how their support options work.

When I have had problems with my MacBooks or ipads, Google Pixels, or Xbox products, I call Apple, Microsoft, or Google and they just take care of it. And on the rare occasion that I have to send my device in for repair it somehow makes sense and seems worth it. When Samsung tells me I need to send in my device to accomplish damn near anything other EXTREMELY basic troubleshooting, it makes me never want to work with Samsung again.  When I call Samsung, I know for absolute certain I will be speaking to someone overseas. I will have long hold times. And the ""support"" option they are going to recommend is to send my device in - doesn't matter what's wrong, they want you to send in your device or jump through more hoops than circus animals to get a replacement. It feels like a cheap way to offer customer support when the competition is so far ahead and delivering massively more efficient and logical customer support.  What gives, Samsung? Why have you seemingly done nothing to improve support. Why do I feel like I'm calling a 3rd world country and speaking with a company who is headquartered in Nigeria??

__aakarsh,1615548489,"TLDR: look at the bold sentences.   I hesitated shifting from iPhone to Android because this is also my first Android phone. I used iPhones for 6 years starting from the iPhone 4 til the iPhone 8 (and iPhone 11 for a week I between).   Things that I dont like about the switch:  1. I have a Mac and an iPad. **The only thing I used often inside this Ecosystem was Airdrop**. I dont use iMessage (no one does in my country). Nor do I use Safari that much. I use Google's productivity suite of apps for getting work done and Google apps are universal and work well on ANY device. But I **really miss Airdrop because its speed and convenience is UNMATCHED**. I have found alternatives but they are not as good as Airdrop, though they get the work done just fine most of the times. 2. This is not Samsung's fault entirely, but **iOS feels just a tiny bit smoother**. The 60Hz display (to me) feels just as smoother as a 90Hz display on any Android phone especially the navigation gestures. Navigating around the UI just feels smoother on an iPhone and there is nothing that has been able to change my mind about this. My Fold is smooth but it can stutter on some occasions. So lets be honest, how much do I really care about slightly smooth navigation around the UI? Not much for me. 3. OneUI (Samsung implementation of Android) has a **gazillion features. It is both its weakness and its strength. It can either overwhelm you and drive you crazy (more on this later) or you can be pleasantly surprised by the density of capabilities you have when you are using a high end Samsung phone.** And unlike other Android implementations I believe Samsung has the most structured way of providing a plethora of features. It just hasnt been done better in the Android world imo (and I have used a Oneplus phone as well). 4. The **Fold 1 still KINDA feels like a beta phone**. Mosly because of its 1st generation hinge mechanism. But since I consider myself a power user I am completely okay with it and its easy for me to ignore it. It gets my work done far more effectively than I expected it to. So I am not complaining.  5. I had to take out a few minutes while setting up the phone to **disable or delete the preloaded stuff that came with my phone that I had no use of. Also had to be careful to not tick mark the option to send promotional and marketing stuff else it would show ads in the phone UI. Not having to do all this on iPhone is sweet** but its not too much of a pain for me personally. 6. I miss water resistance on my phone. But this is just a shortcoming of the folding technology as a whole and not a shortcoming of Samsung.  Things I love about the switch:  1. **Cell reception is in my experience and in my country at least is far better on Samsung than on iPhones**. I know the iPhone 12 series made huge strides in terms of cell reception and 5G and all. But I am only comparing it to my experience with the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 11.  2. I use a pair of **Galaxy Buds Live.** I can charge their case wirelessly. And the fact that I can charge them by simply placing the case on the back of my phone is very convenient. I use it often. 3. my work involves having to deal with a ton of PDFs and I use **Samsung's built in File manager** and my god that app is a beautiful piece of software. It just works SOO well. It's integration with Google Drive is really good for me as I mentioned I am knees deep into the Google software ecosystem. 4. **Samsung dex is again a beautiful piece of software**. Whenever I want to access something from my phone on my computer (while inside the Apple ecosystem that works without having to do anything) I just turn on Samsung Dex on my phone and it wirelessly streams a DESKTOP version of my phone on my laptop and it works REALLY well with really less lag if I am using a 5GHz wifi (which I am almost all the time when I am using my laptop). 5. The **battery on this thing lasts really long** but I am not sure if thats a differing factor cuz latest two generation of iPhones have also had awesome battery life. 6. Finally, and probably the freshest thing I have experienced in a phone.** It folds**. And its a head turner when I am using it out in the wild. EVERYBODY stares at my and my phone all the time when I am using it outside in public. In my country its uncommon to start a conversation with a stranger, so only a few people reach out and ask me about the phone. But their staring eyes are enough for me to tell that they are hella curious about this phone lol. 7. I **have dropped this phone thrice in a span of 6 months already and I can say it is VERY durable**. I use my phones without a case and I dropped this one all the three times when it was folded shut, so maybe thats worth nothing. I am sure if the phone fell when it was unfolded it would break easily. But the kind of hard fall the third one was, my iPhone 8 would have died immediately and this one survived it gracefully. I **credit this to the thick spine (that is covering the hinge from the outside) and the subtle plastic protection around the edges of this phone.**  In all, I can say that I have never been this amazed with my phone in a really long while. It feels fresh and it has completely changed my perspective about phones and the way I use them. Regular phones just dont excite me that much anymore. Sure, they are really good reliable phones that come up with new features every year, but essentially to me they function and look the same.  A metaphor to explain iPhone and Samsung:  Assume these two to be a toolbox. **Samsung is a toolbox that comes with the tools preloaded regardless of the fact whether you would use all the tools or not. You have to REMOVE tools to make a Samsung phone truly yours.** While an **iPhone is an empty toolbox, in which you choose to either keep it empty and simple or add a few software tricks to make it your own by using Siri Shortcuts and customising the icons of the apps (which my god thats tough to do on iOS).** At the end, its all about what you prefer. Good luck if you plan to switch to either side.   About customisation being overwhelming:  You need to come to terms with the fact that customisation is not the main purpose one buys a phone for. Figure out the basics of using the phone. Making calls, social media, and snapping a simple photograph, viewing photographs in a gallery, how to screenshot and how to reset the phone just in case. These are fundamentals that you need to figure out before using a completely new phone. Customisation is secondary. People find it overwhelming because they end up spending hours in one single day trying to customise first. Thats why they draw the conclusion that Android is trash. I first figured out the aforementioned fundamentals and daily for a few minutes I try to figure out just one or two new things about my phone. This makes the phone feel newer and fresher for longer because some days you will discover a feature that will significantly improve the way you use your phone and will blow your mind.",samsung,6 months ago I switched a Galaxy Fold from an iPhone and here are my long-form thoughts
minluske,1615545198,"Hi. I just wanted to take a moment and share my experience with you all about HDR content. I am a complete noob, I only upgraded to a new TV this Monday, so I only had it for a few days. However I wanted to see the looks of the HDR technology. I didn't look up any particular show that was known to have the best HDR looks or anything. I saw on the Netflix app that ""The Queen's Gambit"" had the HDR label. So I had a look, I quickly notice that the scenes was just way too dark, like the face of the main character only had half a face. The scene I talk about is the main character is being interviewed by the news paper, in her bedroom in Episode 3. I did some research as I thought was just a bit too dark to be correct. I discovered a person who had a completely different model though Samsung as well. He had to update the software and it fixed the HDR content on Disney+. I tried to search for an update on  the TV with no luck. But it told be that there might have been and more updated software on their website. I did the update and it was honestly a completely different scene to watch. Took me a few minutes to find the right post, because it seems that people are talking about a lot of different things when they talk about HDR content.  TLDR: Please for the love of god, update your software from the website, if you think your movies or series look too dark in HDR mode.",samsung,HDR Content looks too dark.

NWVoS,1615541528,"In short, using my new S21 5G, I have had my signal drop to X meaning no data connection to Verizon many times a day for the last 10 days or so. In that time, I have factory reset the phones, reset all network settings, set network mode to manual (Verizon), got a new sim from Verizon, spoke with Samsung twice, spoke with Verizon, been to the Verizon store 5 times, and have received a new S21 5G from Verizon with the issue continuing. None of those solutions stopped the problem.  Now, after the 5th store trip and a chat with a rep, I think I might have stumbled upon the solution. During the chat, the rep mentioned he turns his 5G off to stop the switch between 4G and 5G to save battery. That got me thinking, what if all the network bouncing between 4G and 5G I have seen, even just standing in the Verizon store, and the X signal are connected? That said, this issue did only appear recently as in the past 10 days after I installed two updates, so I am not ruling out an update messed something up.  So my theory is that the phone bounces between the 4G and 5G network so much that the phone either gets stuck at no network connection or verizon kicks the phone off temporarily due to excessive request. Right now I am forcing the phone to use the LTE bands using the app Samsung Band Selection on the play store.  In theory you can do the same with Tasker with root, or more cumbersome granting tasker special permission using adb wifi using usb debugging.  In Samsung Band Selection I have network set to LTE ALL under Network Mode. You could use Band Selection to force certain LTE bands, or you could force 5G by using the NR bands. I hope this helps.  Right now, I have had a stable connection for about 6 hours, which is a long time at this point. I have lost connection 3 times in 15 minutes before due to whatever is causing the issue. So this is more a theory in the works than a foolproof solution.  I hope the rest of you experiencing this problem find this helpful in at least knowing you are not alone with this issue.",samsung,"S21 5G goes to X (No Signal) Verizon, Possible Solution."

The only things making me want to take it back for the s21 ultra are being able to do 120hz at wqhd+, the slightly better camera when it comes to macro shots, don't really care about 100x vs 50x in this case but I love taking close ups and the note 20 uktra forces me to use 2x zoom to achieve focused macros because of its huge sensor, and lastly the battery. The battery isn't bad by any means l, but it's also not great. I use my phone quite heavily and find myself charging twice a day sometimes. I was hoping that it would be a little harder for me to get it down to that sub 15 level.  Other then that it's one of the nicest phones I've ever had. I am in love with the design, the bold sharp edges and boxy design make media consumption an absolute joy, games look and play amazingly well with the 120hz display, multitasking is incredibly fluid and is actually quite practical with the huge screen and of course I love the integrated s pen and use it very frequently whether it's just to make a quick sketch, take a quick note or just use it like a mouse for my phone for more precise text and smart selection. I really do feel like I'd miss it. I'm aware to s21 ultra technically has s pen support but I'd have to pay extra for it and then buy a special case for the phone just to make it practical in day to day use. Oh and the expandable storage is basically a necessity in my eyes. Unless there is something I'm missing about cloud storage then the ability to boot apps and roms and edit video files and pictures natively on the SD card seems invaluable for a power user like me. Realistically the note 20 ultra does everything I want it to with only a couple of small caveats and the fact that the s21 ultra would technically cost me about the same minus the S pen and no included 25w charger, whilst technically being the newer phone with slightly better specs.

JediAnonymous,1615391035,"I got the xbox series x and a 75” samsung q800t back in November. I’ve been playing on them since. I noticed there were some odd color flicker that happened during gameplay on Halo.  The issue was quick flashes of different colors (red, blue, green, yellow) from time to time on screen. No where did I see this issue reported, but I did update the firmware in the TV to the latest version (v.1460) a few days after seeing there was one (late November).  The issue kept happening. I thought that maybe it was because I had a digital copy of the game and perhaps it was corrupt. My buddy also said he noticed video issues with his digital copy of Halo too. So I kept playing, it only seemed to happen in Halo. However, in January I downloaded COD:Warzone and it happened there too.  Finally yesterday I got fed up and tried looking for new reports about the issue, but still nothing. I saw there was a new firmware update for the Samsung (v.1462) so I ran it. The issue still didn’t go away.  Looking online the closest issue I could find was with the VRR/game mode on either the console or the TV. I tested all different scenarios and came to the conclusion it’s something with the game mode on the TV.  When the game mode is set to auto or on and I go into those two games the flickering happens. When I turn game mode off the issue goes away. I initially thought it was just the auto setting because in testing when I would switch the setting to on from auto the flicker seemed to stop, but I went to make a video of it and left game mode in the on position for a while and noticed the issue happen again.  Has anyone seen this and more hopefully can someone help me resolve it?",samsung,Xbox Series X &amp; Samsung TV Game Mode Color Flicker Issue

stevexyz8,1615338643,"Please help me decide my upgrade. I need some advices from those who have own both N20U and S21U, better yet also owned the S10 series before.  I currently have the 1TB S10+, which still works pretty good, except the fingerprint. It got better after software updates, but still far from perfect. Especially in the morning. For some reason, it won't unlock most of the time with my fingerprint when I just wake up. I have to unlock using my passwords after 5 fails. But it works much better during any other time, more like 80%\~90%. This is my main complain.  So now I'm thinking to upgrade to either the N20U or the S21U. There are several factors I'm considering between the two:  1. Fingerprint sensor: I know the S21U has a bigger sensor while the N20U has the same one in the S10. But some say there's not much different between the S21's and S20's &amp; N20's. And some say the S20's &amp; N20's are a little better than the S10's. So for those who have owned these phones, can you share some of your insights? 2. Battery life: 4500mAh vs 5000mAh, obviously the S21U here wins in number. But how about actual experience using both phones? Is there a significant difference between the two? 3. Camera: Is the S21U really that much better than the N20U like some of the online reviews said? 4. Storage: Coming from a 1TB S10+ with about 200GB filled, I'd say SD card support of the N20U is  the winner here. Because I can only get the 128GB version of the new phones. If I'm choosing the S21U, then I'll need to move some of my media files to the hard drive of my computer or online cloud. 5. S-pen: Last note I owned was a Note 4. I didn't use the pen much. So it doesn't really matter to me. 6. Price: N20U is about $100\~$200 cheaper ($100 if counting the worth of the free buds with S21U). 7. Software &amp; security update: is the S21U gonna have one more year than the N20U for updates?  Any other difference that I should consider between the two phones that will help me decide?

Blindfaulted,1615266356,"During late 2019 I purchased a Samsung Cj56 1440p 144hz monitor for around 300$ as an upgrade from my 1080p 60hz. I used it for gaming, productivity, entertainment, most stuff people would use it for. That monitor has served me well up until late 2020 when I saw that whenever I turned on the monitor it would turn on pretty glitchy. Just in time right before my warranty ran out, I called them. Addressing the situation, they sent me a UPS return label. I put the monitor in a different box as I did not have my original one and shipped it to them.  I got a message a week later notifying me that my monitor arrived at the repair center located in New Jersey. I waited one entire month and still did not hear back about my repair process. So I called in and checked what was going on. Apparently, they were waiting for a part to arrive to the shop. I called again a week later and asked what happened to the part and they somehow told me in a span of 10 minutes that they have no idea what's wrong with it and I could get a refund. I call the next day asking about the refund and by a surprise, they told me they're sending a replacement one. Another week later I got a notification telling me that my replacement is being shipped and one more week later it arrived.  I open my door immediately after the package came and carried it inside. I took one singular glance and knew something was wrong. I kid you not they sent a completely different monitor. They cent me a CF390. A 1080p 60hz curved monitor that lists for 140$ on amazon. Wtf??? Is this even allowed? As anybody would do I  immediately called Samsung and addressed the situation. They went on about how they didn't have the exact model in hand so they sent me the ""closest"" one. They then told me that I would get a call back from the management team in 1-4 days and sort it out there.

kevinjbonn,1615163735,"So I personally came into a Samsung M7 smart monitor about a week ago and I find the marketing and execution pretty intriguing. I don't know that it's something I would have bought if it weren't available to me at a very steep discount with a credit I needed to burn. It certainly doesn't seem to know what it is, given the fact that in the setup (there was piano music playing during the setup, never had that before) it actually referred to itself once as a TV and another time as a monitor. For my purposes I didn't really care what it called itself, I just knew it was a 4K display that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  I find it to be a really nice product, but pretty much all of their TVs and monitors are nice products with great Packaging and plenty of features. I'm not the best judge of display quality, but after fiddling with the settings I found this to be above adequate. It is not terribly different from the TV I just gotten setup for my mother but they make. Honestly the only real difference seems to be a lack of a coaxial input / antenna function and the fact that it's preloaded with Microsoft Office and certain connectivity features I wouldn't expect in a TV. Despite having the original DEX equipment since it was first unveiled years and years ago I've never really gotten into it. It's kind of neat that I can just tap my phone on the top of the screen and mirror the display, but I'm not sure when I'll ever use that.  There are two things that really put me off about it unfortunately. For one I would really have liked an audio output of some sort aside from the HDMI ARC. I know that's the new standard but even a 3.5 millimeter Jack or an optical out would have made me very happy. Also another HDMI input or DisplayPort input couldn't hurt. But I found myself today trying to answer an Amazon question about it regarding whether it could support Skype and a webcam. I search through every app available in the store and there was nothing for video conferencing. I tried to fire up Zoom after connecting a webcam on the built-in browser, but had absolutely no luck getting it to recognize that peripheral. It's a little odd because it does accept keyboards, mice and a few other peripherals. But I found out to Italy no way to get a webcam working with it. Maybe someone has an idea because I would actually be pretty interested in getting that to happen. It doesn't seem like it would be difficult to add support for zoom in a webcam.  I'm using it to replace a curved Samsung 32 in that did a great job, but just didn't have the same features as this, plus trying to use a curved display as your main media center as part of a PC rig, isn't the best viewing experience. So my thought and what I would be curious to get your input on even if you just seen the marketing for a brief moment or if you on all three of the models is how do you think this positioning of a smart monitor in the market is going to go down over the next year or two? Is this something Samsung should explore? Should they just simply have one line of displays now that the technology is becoming so similar and have everything preloaded with apps and PC connectivity but also be totally functional as a TV? I remember when I first saw advertising for it I said to myself out loud ""what the hell is this?"" and after using it for a bit I still have that same question, but practically all I'm concerned with is the fact that it's a decent 4K display.  I'd honestly be pretty elated if my chg90 ultrawide came with the same bells and whistles they added to deem it a smart monitor. But I wonder if any competitors are even bothering to touch this niche. It's worth noting that after I read the reviews while waiting for it to arrive, I pretty much felt like I was playing the lottery waiting to find out if I'd have a dead display or not. It seemed like half the reviews had dead displays and were pissed about it, and the other half thought it was pretty cool product. So what are you guys think?",samsung,"Smart Monitor is an interesting concept, will it catch on?"

Ted_Ed5,1614925809,"TL:DR My Samsung A21s shipped with OneUI core and is deleting apps by it's own volition.   Okay, so I'm using a Samsung A21s. And for some reason Samsung decided to ship it with OneUI core even though the predecessor (with supposedly worse internals) had full blown OneUI  And ever since I got this phone I've been experiencing random reboots once a week and sometimes daily. Even though the phone has 3GB of RAM it can only hold one app in memory (the previous A20 with 2GB ram had no problem holding +-3 apps in memory). I also get random network issues where my phone suddenly cannot connect to the internet even though I have great reception and the phone shows I'm uploading data but no download at all (rebooting the phone sorts the problem out, but its frustrating enough that I stopped using Samsung for years after my S4 required factory resets in order to fix the problem)  But today, the final straw in my hatred (yes, hatred) for Samsung, I was playing a game when suddenly it stopped working and the phone closed the app down. I didn't think much of it and went on to do other things. Only to discover when I went back to play the game that it had been deleted, even though I did not at any point try uninstalling the game.   Has anyone else experienced anything like this with any recent Samsung phone? I Could it be a problem with OneUi core or OneUI in general? Could it be the Samsung chipset used in this model?   Needless to say, I won't be using a Samsung phone after this one. I came back to Samsung because of the Note 8, stuck with it even after the Note 10 fiasco.

monkeyfunkster,1614901088,"Hi! Have googled this to no end and would be so grateful for specific advice.   So I have had Samsung and onedrive for quite a few years, and always used just a standard automatic upload. Then with my then new note 10+ early last year, I realised a few months in that something weird was happening and I had both an upload *and* the new synced Samsung gallery feature, I think because I used my sd for some pictures (and know now that won't work with the synced gallery) so I had randomly doubles of some photos and nothing of others. Honestly looking back can't work out what happened.   Anyway! I then switched away from the sd back to phone upload and realised the sync had just stopped. It took everything to get it working again (again, not sure how!) and had to upload a hell of a lot manually, as it had only uploaded some of it and ignored most of the videos, so when I assumed it had uploaded everything and clicked to remove synced items locally, my memory was still really full. The only way to work out which videos were missed was to plug my phone into the computer. And a lot of the sd photos I had to manually upload, the motion part had gone, though it was luckily still there on the Google photos backup (I'm a paranoid sort, partly for stuff like this, so I use both)  Well guess what, it's happened again as I stupidly forgot to check it. Gone to send Mum some videos (did a zoom party thing for her bday) and realised none are on there. And I go to the gallery settings, and it says sync is on, but then I go settings&gt;account&gt;onedrive, and it says sync is off. I turn it on, but it misses items (still mostly videos) in the sync, then I'll find it's off again. I've tried deleting the app, removing my account, just lots.   I've seen another thread here saying to just delete the gallery sync and go back to old fashioned upload (though not sure how), but I'd rather not, as I really like having quick access to older pics, and hate the onedrive app as it's a total pain to scroll through a large folder.   And the weirdest thing is it also happens with Google photos, which only wants to sync when I have the app and the sync status bar open. Which isn't practical. Though everything syncs- just takes forever, and I have to be on the ball, making sure the app doesn't time out. And I take a *lot* of photos and videos, even in lockdown.   But yes, just so strange how both keep turning off!  The completely unrelated final thing is I can't turn my phone on normally. If it turns off for any reason (accident, crashes, or dead battery), the only way to turn it back on is pressing up volume at the same time as power and forcing a reboot, or it gets stuck at the logo. Happened for months and months. I'm way too lazy to do a total wipe and restart, but if the sync issue needs it, then I'll have to :(  Would appreciate any help, please! And I'm good with my phone, but not with reading instructions, as most pages online about sync issues have turned me cross eyed, so please  spoon feed me any help, lol!  🤞🤞🤞",samsung,"Onedrive and Google photos syncs keep turning themselves off!

KeatonTS,1614879268,"As part of my $250 preorder bonus I bought the official silicone S pen Case, and the clear protective case with my Galaxy 21 ultra (among other things)   I didn't like the silicone case. It didn't have a good grip, and it takes away the beauty of the back side of the phone.  I really liked the protective case though so I wanted to modify it. And this is the result:     I used an insignia brand apple pen sleeve strap from best buy, cut it up a bit to fit the phone, bought some dual sided tape strong enough to hold upto 16 pounds. Then used a hot glue gun to tick the tape to the pen sleeve (the normal tape adhesive won't stick to the sleeve) then put the adhesive side of the tape on to the phone case and let it sit.   Finally. I bought the S pen for the galaxy tab S7 when It was on sale for $30 since it's a more firm fit than the S pen for the 21 Ultra however. I stuck a bit of filling into the pen sleeve so that the S pen doesn't get pushed into the sleeve and get stuck inside, since the S pen is smaller than the sleeve. I added a popsicket to the case to balance the phone when laying it down and make the grip feel ""fuller"" in the palm.  The verdict: It feels better than I thought. It's a little awkward to look and and hold but I got use to it fast. It's not as snappy and professional looking as the official case but It doesn't add extra real estate to my phone and can keep using my favorite case. The sleeve holds well. Putting it in your pocket is fine but you do notice the pen line. Overall it works. The pen isn't too invasive on the back, I think the pop socket helps. Pulling out the s pen feels right lol.

tigerxchaos,1614865638,"DXOMark recently released their [review](  of the S21 Ultra (Exynos) camera. It shows what I consider to be mediocre camera quality for a $1200 smartphone.  I recently purchased the US version (Snapdragon 512GB) and am similarly unimpressed by the quality of the cameras, particularly the telephotos. It's a good phone and pictures are decent, but...a phone that costs this much and touts its camera specs so heavily really should do better.   I haven't had a Samsung phone since the Note 7 and then the S7 Edge that it got replaced by due to that little problem some people reported of it becoming a lithium bomb, so I know little of Samsung's current practices with regards to cameras and software. Given that this phone is so new, do you all anticipate that software updates will be released to improve camera processing and quality, or do they typically end up ignoring the cameras in their phones unless something is drastically wrong?

I get  a cost  breakdown  and  says  that  the  Icd  screen  needs  to  be  replaced even though it was in perfect condition when I shipped it (UPS packed and shipped it).The  cost  breakdown  clearly  says  ""power  not  working  AFTER  upgrade"". The  repair  center  calls  it  physical  damage  strictly  because  the  button  came  out  even  though  there  was  no  physical  damage.

Also, I should mention, I’m fairly certain I’d be able to get the s21 for basically free, except taxes, and the s21 ultra for like $450 + tax. I know that some people would say why not just get the best phone for such a low price, but the allure of the “free” s21 is getting to me, especially since I’d have to come up with the money for the s21 ultra fairly quickly as the deal doesn’t last too much longer. And I don’t really see any advantage to the plus since it’s basically just a higher s21, but maybe I’m overlooking something…  Thanks in advance for any advice.",samsung,Which s21 to get?

I have an I phone 11 and I’ve had it for almost a year. It’s a great phone don’t get me wrong! But I just really don’t like Apple so much. Also the battery health is already down to 84% which is disappointing.... Anyways, I’ve been wanting to get the Samsung galaxy s20 fe 5G. I live in Australia so if I get the non 5G model the chipset would be exynos instead of snapdragon which I really don’t want. But I am logged into everything on here for my jobs social media (I am Incharge of the social media), and I really don’t want to ask for the password again because I have lost it a few times now. So it would be less stressful to keep this phone to do all of that with and not lose all my logins. But I am also locked into a plan for the next few months. There’s only a little remaining and I have saved up enough money to pay off that price to get the Samsung s20 fe5G under a new plan. And now that I have a job, I told my Mum I can pay her monthly in cash without fail, for the cost of the plan each month. But she doesn’t really like the idea of it.

TalanAcel,1614448479," I   bought the Z Fold 2 on launch and reached out to Samsung regarding the   eSIM. They told me that it was going to be available via a patch  later.  On Sept 23rd/24th they released the eSIM patch but not for the  US  version of the Z Fold 2; I reached out to Samsung again and was told  a  patch was still coming. Doing a bit a of research I saw that the   original Fold was told the same thing and over a year later still didn't   have the eSIM enabled in the US.  I   reached out to the Office of the President for Samsung asking for some   form of resolution regarding this for my Z Fold 2, as I needed the  eSIM  capabilities. This was a big selling point for me due to using two   phones at the time (work and personal) and expecting to only use one   with the eSIM and a physical SIM (like my previous phones could from   Apple and Google). Samsung blatantly told me ""no"" and that there was   nothing I could do.  I filed a suit in small claims against Samsung that day.  Fast   forward a bit and the day of the case the judge agrees with me. I was   honestly surprised that Samsung took time the time and energy to have   representation at the trial but after it was all said and done, the   judge agreed that Samsung had misrepresented the eSIM capabilities of   the phone even with the disclaimers on the bottom; as the phone could   not use eSIM in any way or form on the US advertised model on their   website.  Originally their counsel   had sent notice that they were intended to possibly appeal but then   reversed course and agreed to refund the cost of the phone and consider   the judgement as fulfilled.  \- Proof -  Judgement against Samsung for the cost of the phone:  [   Samsung's representative agreeing to pay the judgement:  [ ",samsung,I sued Samsung over false advertising and misrepresentation of eSIM....and won

PM_ME_YOUR_MAINFRAME,1614346386,"So there's this marketing term called Hybrid Optic Zoom which is highly misleading. Samsung also calls this camera ""telephoto camera"".  It turns out they are using plain old digital zoom. The lens has a 29mm equivalent focal lenght, so it has 1.1x optical zoom, which is pretty far from telephoto, but hey let's say they are using this camera for telephotography, fair enough.  I'm not saying anything about quality, maybe they decided to go with this because they were able to get better zoom performance, that's fine by me, but the marketing is a mess.  What is even more strange for me, is the ""3x hybrid zoom"" of the S21. Why exactly 3x?

The $150 Akg headphones where a glut on ebay and I added a Galaxy 3 Watch on a whim.  I wasn't really excited about buying since my S8 works just fine. It was only an additional $10.  Wow, right?

I followed the deal and it was still there for $10 the next day as well, so at least three days.    Well, they sent me an invoice with the watch swapped out for a $150 store credit.

I decided I would put another Samsung TV in the basement (75 inch series 7) and it is connected wirelessly just fine, but about that time, the 55 inch upstairs stopped connecting.   I have tried resetting the network settings, set a DNS to google of [8.8.8.8](  attempted setting my own IP address on my network (it is showing the correct first 3 numbers, so I changed the last from a 136 to a 75), reset the TV, reset the network settings, etc.  The only thing I haven't done is attempted to reset my router, but since EVERYTHING else works fine on that wireless (20+ devices, using a WiFI 6 capable router with no device limit set) that seems to be a needless step.  I am able to connect this TV to the ISP modem wireless network, but then I lose the Smart things functionality and my Plex server would then stream my signal to the internet and back to me which seems needless, especially given the newer Samsung TV works fine.   I should point out, the new TV was setup using the smart things app as it suggested, so not sure if that knocked something out, but they do have different IP addresses.

rinsf,1613864857,"I've had a lot of phones over the years - I usually buy a case on Amazon for around $10 and it works fine.  I'm now on my second S21 Ultra case from Amazon, and both have the same defect - the case isn't deep enough.  When the case is sufficiently deep, the plastic of the case comes up a little higher than the screen and provides protection for the screen.  So, for example, when the case is the appropriate depth, if you put the phone face down on a table the screen will not touch the table because the lip of the case holds the phone up.  Not with these cases - with both of them, if I put the phone face down on the table, the phone screen touches the table.  I'm wondering if the problem is that they are not making a separate case for the S21 Ultra, and are selling the same case as for the other S21s.

My phone is currently an iPhone 12, I would like to switch to the S21 series. Which one would be worth getting? I am leaning the base S21, but the plus and ultra catch my eye a bit. Is it worth just going with the base for long term use? (3-4 years). 2. I currently have a Apple Watch Series 4. Is the Galaxy Watch 3 the best watch to get right now?

I currently have the AirPod Pros, is it worth keeping these or going for the Buds Pro? Would it be a downgrade? 4. I currently have a MacBook Air M1, which I will be keeping.

Not to mention the lengths you need to go through to install custom fonts or emojis (I know with zfont 3 it works but not with all devices) is indicative that Samsung will only allow you to customize your Samsung under the conditions that the apps you use to customize it with come directly from them, either through goodlock apps or payed themes/icon packs.

This is due to Samsung waiting for approval from Apple.  I've managed to find a workaround which allows Samsung's Smart Switch software to run on Apple M1 machines.  Things you'll need:  * An Apple M1 device (MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini currently) * [Parallels Desktop Technical Preview for Apple Silicon](  (click ""Try Technical Preview"") * [Windows 10 ARM64 Insider Preview virtual disk image](  (You'll need a Microsoft account)  &amp;#x200B;  Step 1: Install Parallels Desktop Technical Preview   You'll need to install this, along with any system extensions that it requires. Once it has installed, follow step 2.  Step 2: Getting Windows 10 to run   Make sure that you've downloaded the image from the Microsoft website. Once you have downloaded it, open Parallels and follow the setup process (it'll say something like attach a VHDX image). Drag the file you downloaded from the Microsoft website into the Parallels window, and then the application will start building the virtual machine.   Follow the Windows 10 setup process and get everything set up, and when you're ready, install Parallels Tools. This may show up as an exclamation mark in the top right corner of that window.  Step 3: Install Smart Switch   Go to the Samsung website and download Smart Switch. Install the program like you would on a normal PC.  Done! Smart Switch will recognise your Galaxy device and you can now take backups and restore, as well as deploy updates.",samsung,Smart Switch on Apple M1 Workaround

HelpMeOutLmao,1613724715,"Let your money make more money for free  Let Your Money Make More Money For Free In An FDIC Insured Bank!!  * What is it? Yotta is an FDIC insured savings account with a better APY then you're getting now, plus the very common chance to get paid every single WEEK just for using their bank. They have a standard APY of .2% for everyone (mine is a full 14% right now, more below) and recurring ""lottery tickets"" worth up to $10,000,000. Use code BAILEYC for 100 extra tickets for free.  * Can I trust them? Yotta uses Plaid to connect to your bank, and everyone knows that Plaid is secure and trusted by almost every company that involves money. Yotta is hosted by Evolve Trust &amp; Bank who was founded back in 1925, and every account is FDIC insured up to $250,000. You can google everyone involved and see that Evolve is a trusted bank, Yotta's leadership team is listed on Forbes ""30 under 30"", they have 2 different investors listed on Bloomberg Market's ""50 Most-Influential Investors in Global Finance"" plus lots of other big name people and companies, and on top of that you can see that almost everyone who uses Yotta has highly rated it and had a good experience with it. Yotta was founded in 2019, inspired by the companies Premium Bonds and Freakonomics, with the mission of helping Americans create an emergency fund, reduce people's losses on lottery ticket purchases since those are scams, and make saving more fun and rewarding for the average person.  * What is my interest rate? Yotta is special in a few ways, one of them being that instead of earning normal ""interest"" like other banks, Yotta directly pays you a .2%  ""savings reward"" on the first of every month straight into your account. That's about 20x higher than what most people are currently earning with their savings account. Chase, Wells Fargo, BoA, BBVA, and more banks all only give you a .01% APY, and many other big banks don't even give you 1/4th of what Yotta's APY is, you'd be extremely lucky to be getting a .05% APY. You're already missing out on 4-20x more earnings right there alone, but this bank gets better.  * Recurring weekly tickets For every $25 in your account, you get 1 free recurring ""lottery ticket"". Every ticket can win $0.01 up to 10,000,000. Plus, just the other week, someone in California won the option between a Tesla Model 3 or $37,990 in cash. The official chances of a ticket being a winning ticket is 1/44, but I've won every single week and don't even have 10 tickets yet. Every night at 7pm EST one number is pulled, every Sunday the winners are announced and the amount is deposited in your account same day. Use the code BAILEYC when signing up for 100 extra free tickets.  * New debit card They recently launched their own debit card as well. Using their card gives you 10% of every purchase in tickets. The card also gives you a 1/500 chance to get your entire purchase completely free. If you spend $2,000 on the card in the first 4 months of receiving it, you get an extra 1,000 tickets too, and spending 2k in 4 months is easily attainable.  * My experience so far Since the start of the year my account had an APY of 13.76% in January and 14.68% so far in February. That means that in Jan I got 13% of the money I had in the account added to it for free, and in Feb I got 14% of the even bigger amount from Jan. Your APY will change month to month based on winnings, but you're promised at least a .2% APY even if you never won a single raffle. I only deposited $125, enough for 5 weekly tickets, but I've still had at least one winning ticket every single week so far. With my 100 sign up tickets, I had 5 of them win that week. Use code BAILEYC for 100 of your own free tickets.  I really like this bank, it's treated me well since I've signed up and it has really good perks. The free chance to win money every week is already pretty cool, and add that on top of the 20x higher APY than big banks offer and you'll see why people like Yotta. You could make one deposit and just let the tickets make money for you every week, or you can use this as your new savings account and set recurring deposits to let your money keep making more money for free. It can't hurt to sign up, you'll either have money safely sitting in an FDIC insured bank for emergencies while it earns more for you, or you'll get lucky one week and win a bunch of money all for living your life the exact same as before just with a better bank. It's a win-win for the consumer, with guaranteed higher interest rates than other banks and free lottery tickets that pay you every week on top, Yotta is truly a bank for the people",samsung,Let your money make more money for free

IllogicalLunarBear,1613442601,"The S21 Ultra 512gb version is probably the best phone I've ever had. I have had Android phones since the Mytouch 3G and have had almost all of the galaxy versions except the S1, S6, S9, and the S20. I really hated Samsung's touchwize skin and over the last few years I have gone with the LG G7 ThinQ, a Pixel 4 Xl, and a Pixel 5 ( I basically get a new one each year). I used to use cyanogenmod aka LineageOS before qualcomm/Samsung locked down the bootloader's. I traded in my S10 for the Pixel 4 XL cause Samsung's software was so annoying and really enjoyed that phone except for the battery life.. The Pixel 5 was just to much of a ""midrange"" phone for me even though I knew that going in, but thought it would be good and wanted a phone with a good battery (which it was if you only used that metric). The Pixel 5 just had too many problems and was sooooo slow. Found out about the S21 Ultra and jumped in head first.  I have had the S21 Ultra 512gb 16g ram for about 2 weeks (since the 4th I think) and oh I am in heaven. So fast, responsive, smooth, and long lasting battery. Workes great with Android Auto and no random weird issues that I had with my Pixel 5. I should say though that ever since updating the FW on my pixel buds they have been iffy but that might be the FW problem. My Galaxy Buds+ sound great and work like a charm. A note is that the Pixel buds sound better on the Pixel and the galaxy buds sound better on the galaxy, sooooo yeah there is that fun.  The in screen fingerprint sensor is pretty good but if you use a glass screen protector I have found that the UV cured ones are best (using amFIlm and not some). Went through a couple traditional screen protectors and the fingerprint is crappy to say the least as it failed about 95% of the time. The UV cured one is much better but still has some issues but found it works well even with wet fingers and works about 95% of the time with dry fingers. I have both thumbs registered twice in slightly different areas (trying out an idea to get full thumb coverage). Keep that in mind.  Never thought I would like a Galaxy phone again but I think I am a convert. Let's see how things go over the next couple weeks though. Considering I got mine at T-Mobile and traded in my Pixel 4 XL for a discount I'm only paying around $700ish total for the phone so can't complain really if it is crappy latter with the amount of space, memory, and cpu speed it has.",samsung,Enjoying the S21 Ultra after ditching the Pixel 5.

teekay61,1613294049,"My S8+ is starting to show its age a bit (the charging port is getting a bit hit and miss) and I'm aware that the security updates are going to stop in May. So now feels like a good time for an upgrade.  When I got my current phone, it was nice and easy in the Samsung world as there were 2 galaxy models and there wasn't a huge difference in price between the S8 and S8+.  I'm now trying to work out the best option between the two different S20FE phones and the various S21 variants and it's all bit more complicated than last time round!  On the face of it, the S20FE seems like a great deal vs. the base S21 model as it's cheaper, has a bigger screen, a bigger battery and a micro SD slot. However, from looking online there seems to be lots of issues with the touchscreen and presumably I would get one less year of software upgrades given it's last year's model (though three years isn't bad by any means).  Conversely, I like taking lots of photos with my phone so am also being pulled in the other direction to get the Ultra.  Any advice would be welcome but the key questions I've got are:  1) How much practical difference is there between the 4G and 5G models of the S20 FE? I'm in the UK so the 5G has a Snapdragon processor vs. an Exonys one for the 4G (which seems to get a bad rep)  2) Looking at prices online - is it worth paying a bit more for the S21 base model vs. the S20FE for the newer processor/ more software updates? The difference doesn't equate to a huge amount if I sold the Galaxy Buds Live that come as a free gift with the S21 models (but not with the S20FE)  3) How bad is the touchscreen on the FE models? Is it a total showstopper or just occasionally annoying?  4) Does the S21+ just have a bigger screen and battery, whereas the Ultra has a slightly bigger screen than the + but also better cameras?  5) How much image quality difference is there between the Ultra and the base model? I like taking lots of photos with my phone but is the price premium (around £340 here in the UK so nearly 50% more) worth it for the Ultra just for the better cameras?  6) Are there any other decent Android alternatives worth looking at? E.g. the OnePlus 8 Pro, which also as a 3x optical zoom? Huawei seems to be producing phones with excellent cameras but there seem to be major software issues as a result of the fallout with the US government (i.e. you can't install Google apps on their latest models).",samsung,Upgrading from S8+

nEMOcunt666,1613156810,"I don't know if this post is welcome here, but as far I know, it doesn't go against the rules.  Now, I don't want to let anyone else down who got the phone, and I may just be me who got a somewhat faulty device,  but my complications with the phone, just get more and more apparent the more I use it.   I received my s21 about two weeks ago. Just the regular model, since I thought the plastic back didn't bother me, and the only other differences I am aware of, is the size of the battery and the phone itself. I was a bit worried about pre-ordering it at first, because of the exynos chip, but from the videos I saw, it seemed to have improved since last year's phone.  The main problem I have right now is the overheating. I have heard many people complain about the phone overheating from short usage of the camera, and have that problem myself, but that's just one of the many places I find it happening. I find that the regular idle temperature of my phone with all my apps closed, pretty much always is around 40°C. When I wake up, I have found it to be at even higher temperatures maybe 50°. As a note I never charge my phone over night, and close all my apps before going to bed. I do have a bad habit of leaving my phone on my bed or a pillow while sleeping, which heats the fabric up and probably only makes the phone heat up even more. I've never had that happen with any other phone I have owned though, so I didn't think that should be a problem when I got it.   I'm not concerned about the 'health' of my phone here and now, but when it's constantly reaching those temperatures, even when I'm not using it, I do get concerned about the long term consequences and battery lifespan.  The most annoying thing I have experienced yet, is going to bed with a half charged phone and waking up with a dead one. I missed my alarm and didn't wake up before 10:00am that's not something you would expect from a completely new phone. It only happened once though, but I have woken up several time with less than 15% again with about 50% before going to bed.  I was tempted by the price point, but if the lifespan of the phone won't live up to my expectations, it suddenly doesn't sound like that good of a deal to me anymore.  Anyways, Thanks for listening if you have read this far. If you have the same phone, I hope you're happy with yours and aren't suffering from the same problems I do.

Well upon getting the phone, I've noticed quite a few things I'm heavily dissatisfied with - and after various googling it seems I'm not alone.  However, I still can't find any answers. All the information I'm finding is from the first release and I'm hoping there's some recent fixes since then.  Issues as follows:  By God, Instagram and Snapchat cameras. I've heard there's something to do with the app screen recording, instead of actually opening the camera like it does with an iPhone? Why isn't this fixable for the app developers? Do they have a secret 'deal' with Apple and optimization?  Taking photos in the camera app is all over the place. While some instances are great, others suffer. I've turned beauty mode off, but I *still* look smoothed. Red tones on my face for example are more pronounced, yet I still look pale. Some parts of the photo are overly saturated, while others are overly soft. *Please* don't tell me I will need to edit all of my photos after the fact..   Overall while the resolution of my old iPhone 8 is not anywhere close to that of the s20, I find things are so much more balanced on the iPhone and things like my skin look appropriately warm and not overly soft/red. Taking photos of my cat in motion are also a huge issue I'm noticing.  Anyone have the slightest bit of information or advice? Today has been my first day using it and while I seriously love all the features of this phone otherwise, the camera is a huge issue for me at this time.

gointhrou,1612992992,"Hey guys,  So, I have the S10+ right now and I'm thinking of upgrading.  So far I've had the S7, S8+ and now the S10+. I've had problems related to the port with every single one of them. The S7 simply went black when I plugged it in. The S8+ had the dreaded moisture detected problem TWICE. And the S10+ simply stopped Fast Charging about 2 months after I bought it and a couple months ago it just stopped working with its own charger. I can still charge it with a generic charger, but not with the charger that it came with.  So, suffice it to say I'm supremely mad at Samsung and more than tired of its bs. I also bought a Samsung Smart TV and had to send it to repair after 1 week bc the 4k looked dark.  I'm not kidding, my family gifted me a Samsung microwave bc I was moving out to my first apartment and I just returned it and bought a different one because that's how sick of Samsung I am.  All of that said, the S21 looks so good... I want it.  Every other time that I've had trouble with Samsung products, I've seen that tons of other people have had the same exact problems.
